# Resort Filters Implementation Summary

## Overview
Modified `searchResortFilters.spec.ts` to implement resort-based filter testing following POM principles. The key difference from accommodation filters is that the "View results by resort" toggle is enabled before performing any filter testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SearchResultPage Class
**File**: `tests/resources/inw_resources/page_objects/search_result_page.ts`

Added new methods:
- `enableViewResultsByResort()`: Enables the "View results by resort" toggle switch
- `waitForResortResults()`: Waits for resort results to load after enabling resort view

### 2. Updated searchResortFilters.spec.ts
**File**: `tests/e2e_tests/inw_tests/search/searchResortFilters.spec.ts`

#### Key Changes:
- **File Header**: Updated to reflect resort filter testing with clear documentation
- **Test Description**: Changed from "Accommodation Filters" to "Resort Filters - Comprehensive Testing"
- **Helper Function**: Added `setupResortSearchResults()` helper that:
  1. Navigates to category search results
  2. Enables "View results by resort" toggle
  3. Waits for resort results to load
- **Test Tags**: Changed from `@accom` to `@resort` for all tests
- **Console Logs**: Updated to reflect "resorts" instead of "accommodations"

#### Tests Modified:
1. **Ratings Filter Testing** - Now tests resort ratings
2. **Best For Filter Testing** - Now tests resort "Best For" options
3. **Board Basis Filter Testing** - Now tests resort board basis options
4. **Facilities Filter Testing** - Now tests resort facilities
5. **Holiday Types Filter Testing** - Now tests resort holiday types
6. **Duration Filter Testing** - Now tests resort duration filters
7. **Budget Filter Testing** - Now tests resort budget filtering
8. **All Filters Combined Testing** - Now tests combined resort filters

### 3. Created Validation Test
**File**: `test-resort-filters-validation.spec.ts`

A simple validation test that:
- Tests the resort setup for each category
- Verifies all filter buttons are visible after enabling resort view
- Confirms resort results are loaded

## Implementation Details

### Resort Toggle Implementation
Based on the recorded test `test-1.spec.ts`, the toggle is activated using:
```typescript
await page.locator('div').filter({ hasText: /^View results by resort$/ }).locator('label').click();
```

### POM Compliance
- All functionality is encapsulated in the `SearchResultPage` class
- Helper methods are reusable across all filter tests
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated methods for setup and validation

### Test Flow
1. **Setup**: Navigate to category search + Enable resort view
2. **Filter Testing**: Same validation logic as accommodation filters but applied to resort results
3. **Validation**: Ensure filters work correctly with resort-based data

## Benefits
- ✅ Follows proper POM principles
- ✅ Reusable helper methods reduce code duplication
- ✅ Clear distinction between accommodation and resort filter testing
- ✅ Same comprehensive filter validation logic
- ✅ Maintains existing test structure and patterns
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Testing Approach
The resort filters use the same comprehensive testing approach as accommodation filters:
- Dynamic filter option discovery
- Real-time availability checking
- "No results" scenario handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Performance considerations

## Usage
Run resort filter tests using:
```bash
npx playwright test searchResortFilters.spec.ts
```

Or run the validation test:
```bash
npx playwright test test-resort-filters-validation.spec.ts
```
