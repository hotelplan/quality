  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Cruising has never been more popular and we're delighted  to introduce this cruise around Croatia to our programme. The coastline around Croatia is truly spectacular with hundreds of tiny islands, some uninhabited with hidden coves; lively harbours and clear, blue seas. The best way to explore this beautiful part of the world is on small ships that can take you to places the big cruise liners could not possibly reach. These cruises are relaxed and informal affairs. The cabins are simply furnished but each has its own shower &amp; w.c. and airconditioning. Both ships have large sun decks where you can work on your tan but there are shaded areas where you can relax with a good book and a cool drink. Meals are very informal. The cruise price includes breakfast and lunch prepared by the on board cook. In the evenings, you're free to explore the harbour and find that little fish restaurant! Every day you'll sail to a different island, swim in another bay and in the evening moor up in a different port. No two days will be the same. We can't think of a more relaxing way to enjoy this beautiful part of the world.</p>
