<p><strong>ITINERARY</strong></p>
<p>This popular cycling tour starts and ends in Bregenz. The entire route is well sign-posted but you will also receive detailed route descriptions and a map.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 1 </strong><br />Arrival at Zurich airport (alternatively Innsbruck or Munich, on request) and unescorted train transfer to <strong>Bregenz</strong> (approx 2 hrs from Zurich, 2 1/2 hrs from Innsbruck or 3½-4 hrs from Munich), check in at your hotel (Ibis or Central, 1 night) and collect your bike in Bregenz. If time allows perhaps take a ride on the Pfänder cable-car or visit the Sacred Heart Church.</p>
<p><em>'If time allows on your arrival day, I would recommend a frst stroll through the Old Town and along the beautiful lakeside. I admired the impressive lake stage of the Bregenz Festival House and enjoyed a delicious piece of homemade cake at Theatercafe Troy.' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager)</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 2 | 45km | Bregenz to Arbon</strong><br />Start your cycling adventure in Bregenz. Test your rental bicycles thoroughly and perhaps take a short test ride before setting off on your first leg of the tour. Today's journey isn't very far, so you can cycle at a gentle pace and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the nature reserve <strong>Seespitz/Alpenrheinmündung. </strong>It's worth stopping in the village <strong>Hard</strong> to enjoy the lake views (that's where our main image was taken, see the top of the page). You will also cycle through <strong>Rorschach</strong> in Switzerland today, and your final destination for today is <strong>Arbon</strong>. Overnight at Hotel Seegarten in Arbon (1 night).</p>
<p><em>'I especially enjoyed the natural beauty of the Seespitz/Alpenrheinmundung on the first day. For lunch or a refreshment stop on the first day, I recommend guest house Fischerhutte in the nature reserve, from where you can enjoy beautiful lake views. Do allow time for a stroll through Arbon's Old Town and promenade at the end of the day, as it's well worth seeing and as your legs might need some stretching at the end of the first day.' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager). </em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 3 | 68km | Arbon to Singen/Rielasingen (via Kreuzlingen &amp; Stein am Rhein)</strong><br />The first part of the journey from Arbon to Kreuzlingen is a longer stretch along the lakeside. You will pass numerous lidos and small villages en route to <strong>Kreuzlingen</strong>. The highlight of the day is a visit to <strong>Stein am Rhein</strong>, a beautiful town with plenty of attractions worthwile to see. Perhaps visit the Church of St. Johann, or the Town Hall from the 18th Century. From there, cycle to your allocated hotel to one of the small German towns, either <strong>Singen</strong> or <strong>Rielasingen</strong> (2 nights, accommodation either in Singen (Holiday Inn or Hotel Victoria) or in Rielasingen (Hotel Krone or Hotel Löwen. Day 3 covers the longest distance (68km), so if you don't want to cycle so far today, the tour can be shortened as required by train (pay locally).</p>
<p><em>'If you want to spend less time cycling and more time exploring Kreuzlingen or Stein am Rhein today, I would recommend you either set off early in the morning, or you could shorten today's journey by taking a train for a part of the journey (regular train service along the lake, pay locally)'. (Anni Mothes, Product Manager)</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 | 54km | Day excursion to Schaffhausen and the Rhinefall</strong><br />A return cycle tour to <strong>Schaffhausen</strong>, a pretty town with Gothic and Baroque buildings and Munot Castle, surrounded by vineyards and offering stunning views of the Rhine. Schaffhausen has a charming Old Town filled with small shops and cafes. Later cycle along the Rhine until you reach the <strong>Rhinefall</strong>, Europe’s largest waterfall, 3km from Schaffhausen. Return to Singen by train (pay locally) or cycle back.</p>
<p><em>'Today's highlights are definitely Schaffhausen's pretty Old Town and Munot Castle as well as the stunning Rhinefall waterfall, all three definitely a must-see!' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager).</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 5 | 45km | Singen/Rielasingen to Constance (via Radolfzell and Reichenau)</strong><br />Cycle along the peninsula <strong>Höri</strong> to the <strong>Radolfzeller</strong> Moos and to the convent island <strong>Reichenau</strong> where we recommend a circular tour of the island. Cycle to <strong>Constance</strong> (Hotel am Hafen, 1 night).</p>
<p><em>'If you prefer to take it easy today and not cycle the full distance, I recommend taking the train from Singen to Radolfzell (pay locally). Today's route is especially enjoyable from Radolfzell onwards. The convent island Reichenau as well as the Old Town of Constance are well worth a visit.' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager)</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 6 | 49km | Constance to Friedrichshafen (via Mainau and Meersburg)</strong><br />Best to start early today as today's leg of the journey includes many special highlights. Cycle along the lake to the beautiful <strong>Flower Island Mainau</strong> (entrance included). Leave your bikes at the entrance and explore this beautiful island on foot (you will need at least 45 minutes, but some visitors enjoy it so much that they spend many hours here). Afterwards, via ferry from Wallhausen to Überlingen (included) and then by bike to Klosterkirche Birnau. Stop in <strong>Meersburg</strong> and perhaps visit Germany’s oldest castle in this romantic wine-village. This region is especially picturesque and there are plenty of perfect picture-taking spots en route. Overnight in Friedrichshafen (Hotel Goldenes Rad, 1 night). Depending on what time you arrive in Friedrichshafen, perhaps visit the Zeppelin museum.</p>
<p><em>'Mainau and Meersburg are both well worth longer visits. The cycling path along the Northern shore of Lake Constance are especially beautiful. Perhaps if time allows enjoy some wine-tasting in Meersburg or the surrounding villages?' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager)</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 7 | 38km | Friedrichshafen to Bregenz (via Lindau)</strong></p>
<p>Cycle through the <strong>Argenmündung</strong> nature reserve (optional extension to Laimnau +18km) and through the charming Bavarian town of <strong>Lindau. </strong>Allow 1 or 2 hours to stroll through this picturesque town and perhaps do some sightseeing. From there, it's just a short cycle back to Bregenz (Ibis or Central, 1 night).</p>
<p><em>'As today's journey is quite short, there is plenty of time for some sightseeing and relaxing in Friedrichshafen, Lindau or Bregenz. I do recommend a last refreshment stop in pretty Lindau. Perhaps have a 'Radler' or a piece of well deserved homemade cake in Lindau, and celebrate your achievement of cycling all the way around Europe's third largest lake.' (Anni Mothes, Product Manager) </em></p>
<p><strong>DAY 8 </strong><br />Departure or optional additional nights in Bregenz, Lochau or Lindau.</p>
