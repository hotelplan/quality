<p>Schools out, its summer time!</p>
<p>Plenty of families across the UK use the school summer holidays to pack their bags and take their children off on fun, educational and relaxing holidays. Whilst the Alps are best known for being a world-famous skiing destination, during the summer there are plenty more activities to be enjoyed in these wild and rugged hills that range from something for the adventurous daredevils, through to flower arranging workshops and getting close and personal with mountain goats!</p>
<p>Children come in all shapes and forms and there is never a ‘one size fits all’ summer holiday to keep the whole gang satisfied... but since Inghams have such a huge selection of destinations that come with an array of exciting and engaging activities in resort, we’re confident we’ll be able to rustle up the perfect family holiday for you!</p>
<p>From white water rafting, through to exploring mysterious cliff top castles, there is no end to the fun to be had on your summer holiday to the lakes and mountains regions. We’ve pulled together 11 of our favourite destinations and some of our favourite things to do with the kids in tow, taking into consideration ages, interests and those vastly varying energy levels.</p>

Neuschwanstein Castle, Berchtesgaden, Germany</strong><br /><br />Come and see the castle that inspired Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty! Children absolutely love the Neuschwanstein Castle, which is located in <a data-udi="umb://document/04e03f5c842c48279d8406095eb78480" href="/{localLink:umb://document/04e03f5c842c48279d8406095eb78480}" title="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a> in Southern Germany, nestled up against the base of the Bavarian Alps. The castle itself is instantly recognisable and is a gothic baroque playground, with hundreds of grand sprawling rooms, full to the brim with history of Kings, Queens, Princesses and Princes. <br /><br />You would be forgiven in thinking that Neuschwanstein Castle has stood on its rocky outcrop for thousands of years, but actually it was a glimmer in the romantic eye of King Ludwig II of <a data-udi="umb://document/baf439b4f3004bcdbcf23a91adb08ac5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/baf439b4f3004bcdbcf23a91adb08ac5}" title="Germany"><strong>Germany</strong></a>, who made his dream become a reality. Ludwig II was a romantic fantasist who was bewitched with the idea of creating himself a castle, and home, filled with ideas of chivalry and knights and maidens. <br /><br />There is also an active children’s programme at the castle to keep the little ones engaged, with Leo the Lion acting as the guide. Children can learn about aristocracy, tackle puzzles in classic works of art, learn to identify different symbols in coats of arms and more. <br /><br />While the castle itself is obviously the main attraction, the climb up the hill is very rewarding for children as well, with opportunities to stop for a snack and a bite to eat.</p>

Approximately 200 animals live here in Tyrol’s largest outdoor enclosure on 40 hectares and you can enjoy a fantastic day time tour of the four-footed friends!</p>
<p>A real educational trip, children can learn all about deer, lynx, wild boar, yak, zebu, marmots, wild ducks, pheasants, peacocks, ibex amongst other Alpine and mountain animals. The whole wildlife park is an educational adventure for children, who can join the mascot Willy the Wild Boar, who will get you to copy the playful characteristics of animal behaviours, learn interesting facts about surviving in the harsh climate, learn how a mountain goat keeps his balance... and more! <br /><br />Best part, there is also a little petting zoo! Donkeys, rabbits, goats, llamas, sheep and many more animals love getting a pat on the head (and maybe a tasty carrot too!), and are more than happy to strike a pose for your family holiday photos. All the animals in the petting zoo are docile and tame, and have met hundreds of children in their lifetimes. <br /><br />The Aurach Wildlife Park is situated a short distance from the beautiful summer resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/0424394c50b54ef4848722ee185d0739" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0424394c50b54ef4848722ee185d0739}" title="Kitzbuhel">Kitzbühel</a>, where there are plenty of activities to keep the whole family occupied all year around.</p>

The Green Ring Walk, Lech, Austria</strong><br /><br />Getting out and about is a great way to bring the family together through shared experiences. The mysterious and fabled Green Ring Walk in <a data-udi="umb://document/f5a2404579b84c448ac2a43bfaacfdd0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f5a2404579b84c448ac2a43bfaacfdd0}" title="Lech">Lech</a> is a great outdoors family activity, but perhaps one that is best reserved for the kids who are full of beans and used to getting out in the outdoors. The walk can be broken down into 3 stages, 1 stage per day. <br /><br />The walk takes you over hills and mountains, past great lakes and bubbling springs of water. Rocks as large as houses, and staggering cliffs above. Being so isolated in the wilderness, the Green Ring Walk really gets you back to the roots of nature and you’ll see plenty of Alpine wildlife and flora along the way.</p>
<p>The walk is also riddled with tales and folklore. Learn about the mysterious hidden treasure of Lake Zürs, and see the famous ‘Lech Wall’- a 50m long structure made up of stones that hold the names of all the inhabitants of Lech and Zürs (a sentimental ‘archive’ designed to survive the digital age). <br /><br />Families will encounter along the way the ‘Mystery Green Ring’, a stretch of the walk dedicated to interactive obstacles and outdoor toys for children to enjoy. Children will be given a task book at the beginning of the walk, which holds all the objects that they need to solve the puzzles, unlock the doors, and crack the riddles to become the Riddle Master! Fun with water, physics and air, this section of the walk has been designed to engage children who might be tired of walking up and down hills all day.</p>

Children will love running about the wild flowers, through the trees and past the mysterious sculptures crafted by the artist Andre Heller amongst other famous contributors.</p>
<p>The garden is not only as playful as it is educational. Plant species from across the world thrive in this micro-climate on the shores of Lake Garda, and the garden has been hailed an ‘Eden’. Guests can travel through a world that unites nature and art, and see the plant arrangements that mimic the Alpine setting. <br /><br />The gardens are also the home to plenty of wildlife too. Ponds are brimming with Koi fish, dragonflies, and butterflies flitter here and there. Children are encouraged to be respectful to their surroundings but also interact with them: smell the flowers, identify different bird calls, play the interactive musical instruments, and walk through tunnels and archways!</p>

Flavours range from the traditional vanilla, chocolate and pistachio, through to the more bizarre and exotic like bubblegum and tropical!</p>
<p>The town of Montecatini itself is the perfect hub for a holiday in Tuscany, Italy. With the sea side resort of Viareggio within an easy distance, and the ancient and fascinating city of Florence just over the hills, your trip to Tuscany will be filled with excitement, adventure and long afternoons spent basking by the swimming pool (and that extra serving of gelato, of course!).</p>

You can either opt to grab a raft together as a family team, or go for small 2-person crafts, but be aware that these are more vulnerable and not great for amateur white water rafters.</p>

<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>Il Palio delle Barche, Lake Trasimeno, <a data-udi="umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904}" title="Italy">Italy</a></strong></p>
<p>If you’re looking for a festival that’s a bit louder and livelier, then look no further than the exciting and fast paced il Palio delle Barche, that takes place in Passignano sul Trasimeno, on the shores of <a data-udi="umb://document/24a88c57973b4e2c9dfbd2e6a719afde" href="/{localLink:umb://document/24a88c57973b4e2c9dfbd2e6a719afde}" title="Lake Trasimeno">Lake Trasimeno</a> in Umbria. Set during the first week of the UK school summer holidays, this is not the one to miss! <br /><br />Typically translating into ‘The Festival/Competition of Boats’, il Palio delle Barche is a boat race and historical enactment of the power struggle between two important Perugian families, the Baglioni and the Oddi. 4 competing teams from the town, each with their own colours, spend several weeks warming up to the race. And finally on the evening itself the air is electrified with excitement and adrenaline as the teams race to complete the obstacle course (through the town, on the lake) to get their team flag to the finishing point first. <br /><br />What could be better than to get the children cheering along for their favourite colour?! If your little ones love playing football and watching races then they will love this. Make sure you head there early to grab a good lakeside viewpoint because the festival is immensely popular in the area and can attract quiet a crowd.</p>
