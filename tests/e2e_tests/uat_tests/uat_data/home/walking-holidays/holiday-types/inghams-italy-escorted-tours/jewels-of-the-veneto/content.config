<p>The region of the Veneto has so many gems to discover. Of course, it’s well known as home to the waterways of Venice, but the cities of Padua and Vicenza are equally fascinating with amazing architecture and priceless works of art. The popular Italian bubbly, Prosecco is produced here so the tour wouldn’t be complete without visiting a winery! <br />The charming medieval town of Cittadella is our home for the week and the Hotel Filanda offers peaceful gardens to relax in whilst being just a short walk from the centre.</p>

<h2>ITINERARY</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> | Arrive on your chosen flight to Venice and transfer to Cittadella. As we offer a range of regional flights, not everyone will arrive at the same time but you will meet up with your Tour Leader and fellow travellers in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong> | A short drive away lies the pretty town of <strong>Asolo</strong>, known as 'the town of a hundred horizons' for its wonderful mountain views. After our visit to Asolo we visit the <strong>Villa Maser</strong>, another of Palladio's architectural masterpieces.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong> | The nearby city of <strong>Vicenza</strong> has an abundance of neo-classical treasures by the 16th century architect Andrea Palladio. A walking tour of the centre will visit the Teatro Olimpico and other important buildings from the outside, such as the Basilica. After free time for lunch we visit Palladio's famous villa, La Rotonda, which was a great influence on 17th century British style. <br />Please note that the programme may change in order to accommodate the opening times of the Villa La Rotonda.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong> | A day at leisure to explore the delights of medieval <strong>Cittadella, </strong>or perhaps join your Tour Leader for an optional trip by train to <strong>Venice</strong> to see one of the most fascinating cities in the world (cost of train and water bus not included).</p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong> | Just a short drive away lies the beautiful city of <strong>Padua,</strong> famous as home to the Basilica dedicated to St Anthony which we’ll see as part of our guided tour. The tour also includes the famous Scrovegni Chapel which is lined with the amazing 14th century frescoes by Giotto.</p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong> | Sparkling, fruity <strong>Prosecco </strong>has become one of our favourite drinks and so today we learn more about it with a visit to the vineyards of the <strong>Valdobbiadene</strong> region which is the heart of the Prosecco district. The landscape is beautiful with churches, ancient villages and impressive abbeys surrounded by rows and rows of vines. We visit the cellars of a winemaker and enjoy wine tasting and a light lunch of typical Italian cuisine is also included.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong> | Today you have another opportunity to relax in <strong>Cittadella</strong> or you could opt to take a train to visit the nearby town of Bassano del Grappa, where you can visit the grappa museum and learn how they make the local ‘firewater’.</p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong> | Transfer to Venice airport for your flight home or create your own multi-centre holiday by enjoying one of our other great destinations such as Venice, Florence or Lake Garda.</p>
