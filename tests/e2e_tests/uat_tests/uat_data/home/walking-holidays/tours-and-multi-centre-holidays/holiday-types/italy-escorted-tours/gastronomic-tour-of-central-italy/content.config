<p>This exclusive tour takes you on a journey through some of the most important foodie cities of Italy, taking in their culinary delights and colourful histories. With a maximum group size of 12, you’ll get to experience some of the best food and unmissable sites of Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria in an intimate environment with a passionate guide.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> </p>
<p>Fly to beautiful Bologna where you will be greeted at the airport by your tour guide and transferred to your hotel. Once you’ve settled in, you can join your fellow travellers and tour guide for a welcome drink and a run through of the coming days’ itinerary.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong> </p>
<p>Start the day with a hearty breakfast but be sure to leave room as today’s itinerary takes you to two food factories in this fabulous city known as <em>‘The Fat’</em>! Firstly, you’ll learn the history behind Italy’s most loved and utilised cheese, see it being made and stored before helping yourself to some delicious samples. From here, the afternoon will take you to a ham factory where you’ll learn the process of creating two of Italy’s most popular exports, Prosciutto and Mortadella before stopping for a spot of lunch.   </p>
<p>Once lunch has settled and everyone’s plates are clean, you’ll embark on a fabulous walking tour of <a data-udi="umb://document/17128dbb97a245cc842587a71ac17fa4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/17128dbb97a245cc842587a71ac17fa4}" title="Bologna">Bologna</a> itself. As well as ‘<em>The Fat</em>’, this city is also known as ‘The Red’ for its terracotta rooftops which you’ll be able to view from the Asinelli Tower, then stroll through the Piazza Maggiore and take in the stunning architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong> </p>
<p>Leaving <em>‘The Red’</em> behind, cast your eyes forward to <a data-udi="umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b}" title="Florence">Florence</a>, the city world renowned for its exceptional Renaissance art and outstanding baroque architecture. Enjoy a lunch at any one of the cafes in the city where you’re bound to find a plethora of Florentine specialities such as crostini with pâté and fresh tomatoes or for those with enough room, the Bistecca alla Fiorentina which is a succulent T-bone steak cooked over roasted chestnuts and finished with lemon. After lunch, your guide will lead you through the streets of the city, the piazzos and the various districts of this vast medieval city. In the evening, you will be transferred to Assisi where you will stay overnight in preparation for the second part of the tour.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong> </p>
<p>After breakfast, your guide will take you out to the town of Orvieto, one of the most dramatically positioned towns in <a data-udi="umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053" href="/{localLink:umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053}" title="Umbria">Umbria</a>. Balanced atop a cliff of volcanic red rock, Orvieto is at the centre of Italy’s food and wine movement and is home to one of the most influential food festivals in the country –usually taking place in September- with chefs from around the world coming to sample the wares. A cable car will take you to the top of the town where you’ll be rewarded with unparalleled views of the Umbrian countryside below and you’ll have the opportunity to visit the breath taking Duomo which dates back to the year 1330. Lunch today will take place at a local winery where you can sample the regions finest wines.</p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong> </p>
<p>A highlight for those of you with a sweet tooth, today brings with it a trip to the Perugina chocolate factory giving you an insight into how it is made using both modern and age old techniques which give the chocolate from this region its truly unique taste. Not forgetting to bring some samples with you, your guide will then lead you through the lanes of Perugia taking in such sights as the incredible Fontana Maggiore, Cattedrale di San Lorenzo and National Gallery where some of the finest works of art dating back to the 13<sup>th</sup> century can be found on the walls.  After lunch, you will travel to the birthplace of St Francis, the quaint hilltop town of Assisi where you will have the opportunity to take in the grand buildings and breath-taking views of this medieval town and UNESCO heritage sight.</p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong> </p>
<p>On today’s horizon is the town of Urbino, a walled city within the heart of <a data-udi="umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053" href="/{localLink:umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053}" title="Umbria">Umbrian</a> countryside. The morning offers tours of the spectacular Palazzo Ducale, built in the 15<sup>th</sup> century and home to a secretive subterranean hallways which served as the former haunts of Renaissance artists such as Federico Barocci and Raphael.  Lunch will be served at a local restaurant and –season permitting- glorious local truffles will be included. A wander back through the idyllic terracotta buildings and narrow streets resting in the shadows of the surrounding mountains will end with your transfer to the Adriatic coast where the evening is yours to explore the town before dinner in a fabulous local restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong> </p>
<p>Channel your inner Gini D’Acampo with a morning of cookery classes, learning the traditional tricks of cooking Italy’s most famous dishes. After enjoying the fruits of your labours, the afternoon will be spent exploring the San Marino Republic known as the fifth smallest country in the world.</p>
<p>Founded in 301 AD by San Marinus, this stunning fortified town is positioned on the very top of the mountain, providing some of the most awe inspiring views one could hope to see.</p>
<p>Take the cable car over Borgo Maggiore up to the top of Mount Titano and of course revel in the spectacular food and wine San Marino has to offer. Known for its hearty red wines and delicious salamis from the Emilia Romagna region, you certainly won’t go hungry!</p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong> </p>
<p>As your trip draws to a close, your tour guide will advise you of the pickup time for your transfer back to the airport for your flight home.</p>
