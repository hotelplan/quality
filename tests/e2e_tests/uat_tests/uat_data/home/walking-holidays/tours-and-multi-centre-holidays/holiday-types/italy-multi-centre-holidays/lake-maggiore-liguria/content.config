<p><span>Start your holiday in the Southern Alps on the shores of Lake Maggoire. Blessed with a gorgeous Mediterranean climate, this stunning lake offers beauty in both its natural setting and its lavish architectural wonders. Elegant Baroque, Art Nouveau and Neoclassical palaces and villas with their perfectly manicured formal gardens line the waters edge, built by wealthy noble families. In the warmer months spend time lounging on the tranquil waters edge at one of the lakes elegant and refined beach clubs. To really get a feel for the opulence of Maggoire and its gracious past head to the west of the lake where lie three small islands, named after the Borromeo Family. This aristocratic family claimed ownership of the land in the 16th and 17th centuries. Isola Bella and Isola Madre were transformed from rural fishing villages into grand Lombard Baroque residencies with perfectly curated botanical gardens, designed by the top architects and horticulturalists of the time. Isola dei Pescatory remains a window into the past, still retaining a simple traditional charm. Spend days exploring the region by water and by land, taking in its history and gastronomic delicacies whilst walking in the footsteps of writers, poets, artists and aristocrats as you experience the old world charm of Lake Maggoire. In the evening choose from one of the elegant lake side bars and restaurants to enjoy and apritivo beside the tranquil waters of the lake with its stunning mountain backdrop. <br /><br /><img src="/media/13072566/adobestock_128436397.jpeg" alt="" data-udi="http://admin-inghams.hotelplan.co.uk/media/13072566/adobestock_128436397.jpeg" /></span><a data-udi="umb://document/61b9b813ca6d419794fd819362771320" href="/Liguria" title=""><br /></a>Head to the coast for sun, sea and infinite glamour on the Italian Riviera.
