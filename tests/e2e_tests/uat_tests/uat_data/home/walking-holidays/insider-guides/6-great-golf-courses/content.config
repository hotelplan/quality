<p>“Why would I go on holiday to play golf?” is the constant refrain of many. Well, let us tell you that many of the most stunning alpine vistas can be enjoyed from many of the perfectly cut fairways of these beautiful golf courses. Many of these courses also pose some fantastic new challenges that can catch out even the most seasoned of golfers. So why not pick up your clubs, embrace some excitement and enjoy the game?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Top tips when playing golf on holiday</strong><br />• Call ahead - the club may be able to arrange an opponent to play with you or even a four ball.<br />• Stay hydrated, you may be playing in temperatures you’re not used to, so be sure to pack extra bottles of water.<br />• Enquire about hiring a cart as particularly with the warmer climate it will make playing much easier.</p>

<p>In recent years <a href="/{localLink:464a93f8-b678-4756-ba05-62e25210255c}" title="Kitzbuhel">Kitzbuhel</a> has become as famous for golf in summer as it has been for skiing in winter. The Eichenheim is a remarkable course. It was designed by Kyle Philips, who also designed the Kingsbarns in Scotland. Opened in 2000, this is the newest course in the state of Tyrol. <br /><br />Nestled in the alpine range with the Wilder Kaiser mountains as a back drop, this stunning design from Philips follows his ethos that a golf course should have its own unique personality and should be in keeping with the existing landscape. <br /><br />This par 71 course is a staggering 6,092 metres in length, but there are some great e-cars available to hire with GPS if you don’t fancy the walk. The prestigious Austrian Masters was hosted here in 2001 and as this course grows and ages we reckon many more competitions will be held here. <br /><br />You will also find some exciting sights along the course such as steep cliff edges, streams and forests, which although may be beautiful to look at, can also prove to be very challenging to play around. <br /><br />Many of the tees are elevated, making it easy to see down the fairway however it can be hard to judge the distances therefore we would suggest you pick up a course planner before you play. <br /><br />Kitzbuhel and the surrounding area is well-known for the golf courses on offer, therefore if the Eichenheim isn’t to your liking you’ll have a few others to sample when on holiday with us. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> Stay at the <a href="/{localLink:85d955fe-f216-43d6-ad83-68b34b96be3e}" title="Garden-Spa Hotel Erika">Garden-Spa Hotel Erika</a> and receive free golf club hire and a discount on green fees Mon – Thurs.

Evian, Morzine, France</span> <br /><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064657/_0005_evian-resort-golf-club-08.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/3833e27475954805897aae7fcb3c2377" /><br /><em>© Evian Resort, Morzine. </em><br /><br />The Evian golf course is not for the faint hearted! With some very narrow fairways and tricky greens, you can see why they started the Evian Championship for the pros. <br /><br />If the course isn’t difficult enough, it’s hard to stay focussed when you are surrounded by such amazing views with the mountains in one direction and the lake in the other. <br /><br />In 2013, the course saw a big renovation with five holes being completely redesigned; this took the course to a whole new level. Bigger bunkers and wider lakes were put in place to really test your golf ability therefore if you have already played this course before, it might be time to revisit! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> Receive a warm welcome at the <a href="/{localLink:d17098bf-deb4-40e6-b8d5-22b89743b5b4}" title="Hotel Les Champs Fleuris">Hotel Les Champs Fleuris</a>.

Due to the high demand of visitors, more villas and hotels had to be built in order to accommodate. <br /><br />As there were so many Brits around the lake they were keen to create a similar British culture, hence the introduction of golf to the area. <br /><br />The Menaggio and Cadenabbia Golf Club opened in 1907 with just a simple nine hole course but in 1919 a new president took over the club and purchased more land in order to extend the course to a full 18 holes. <br /><br />Today, the club is a firm favourite of both tourists and locals not only for the course but also for the quintessentially British style clubhouse. Whilst the style of the course and the clubhouse sticks to its roots, the menu on the other hand has some great Italian inspirations served up by chefs, Massimo Salomoni and Aurelio Della Torre. <br /><br />If you do not wish to take your clubs with you, fear not, the club offers a great standard of rental equipment at an affordable rate. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> The lovely <a href="/{localLink:5d3abc62-0624-4dcc-9c04-086ee2c25e2c}" title="Grand Menaggio Hotel">Grand Menaggio Hotel</a> is perfectly located on the edge of the lake.

<p><span id="4" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">4. Circolo Golf, Venezia, Italy</span><br /><br />The story has it that Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Company arrived in <a href="/{localLink:ef8c0c34-9aa0-461a-a39c-2d4ccd8fc1f7}" title="Venice">Venice</a> with his bag and clubs ready to play a round on his holiday and embarrassingly Count Volpi di Misurata had to break the news to him that there were no golf courses in the area. <br /><br />Determined not to disappoint any further visitors, Count Volpi set out to find somewhere he could build a golf course. Work began in 1928 with the Scottish architect Maxwell M. Hart. <br /><br />The original course was built around an old Austrian settlement including stables and army quarters that now form part of the current clubhouse. <br /><br />Described as a great escape from the crowds of Venice and ideally located at the end of the lido, we would definitely recommend a visit! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> Stay on the Grand Canal in Venice with the beautiful <a href="/{localLink:20afe5c0-19d0-41a5-8012-0bc2c5c82600}" title="Hotel Palazzo Sant'Angelo">Hotel Palazzo Sant’Angelo</a>.

The course has a park, recreational feel to it, making it very easy to walk as the terrain is fairly flat. This does not mean your views are compromised as the mountain scenery surrounding the lake gives you the best of both worlds. <br /><br />A new feature of this course is that on their website you can view each hole in a new 3D animation. So you can begin familiarising yourself with the course before you even arrive in resort. Get practicing! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> The fabulous <a href="/{localLink:8d08a541-fdb5-43fe-909f-98051d49af84}" title="Hotel Salzburgerhof">Hotel Salzburgerhof</a> is perfect for those who fancy a little luxury during their stay.
