<h2 id="Tips" style="text-align: left;">Walking Etiquette, According To Our Experts</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13099497/picture-3-report-1.jpg" alt="Walking Etiquette" data-udi="umb://media/760fe6f79225465281ffa81cd87b3c73" /></p>
<p>Being aware of walking and trail etiquette can make or break yours and other walkers’ experiences while out on a trail. Although walking etiquette is synonymous with common courtesy - it isn’t always obvious how to behave or what rules to follow, especially when walking in an area or country different to your own.</p>
<p>Knowing the dos and don’ts of trail walking is essential for respecting the environment you’re in and maintaining a positive environment amongst fellow walkers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we’ve shared our top walking etiquette rules that all walkers should be following:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>1. Right of Way</h3>
<p>Questions around walkers’ right of way are one of the most common when it comes to walking etiquette. Luckily, there are commonly appreciated rules around who has the right of way while out walking or hiking.</p>
<p>For example, downhill walkers should always yield to uphill hikers when on a mountain or hill. This is because walkers climbing uphill have a narrower field of vision and are working against gravity to achieve pace and momentum, so it's common courtesy to give uphill hikers right of way.</p>
<p>In a similar way, solo hikers should always move for big groups - especially if the big group is hiking in single file as per standard trail etiquette. Solo hikers will find it easier to step aside and let the group pass - just remember to move aside to the right and pass on the left. </p>
<p>Finally, if you’re not walking on a trail, bear in mind that: bikers yield for hikers, bikers yield for horses, and hikers yield for horses too. Keeping these general right of way rules in mind will help to avoid any awkward encounters out on the trails.</p>
<p>Lewis, our resident walking expert based in Switzerland, comments “Walkers will often hear mountain bikers coming and try and jump out the way. But jumping into the gap the cyclist was intending on moving into can often cause people to get lost and sometimes even cause big accidents.”</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. Bathroom Etiquette</h3>
<p>Sometimes nature calls when you’re out in nature. If you must take a comfort stop, first always check for an outhouse or public facilities that are nearby. If there’s nothing suitable available then best practice is to go at least 200 feet away from any trail, campsite or water source to do your business.</p>
<p>Use your common sense though, and if 200 feet from the trail isn’t possible then try your best to find a private spot behind a tree or rock so that other walkers aren’t caught by surprise. Be sure to take any tissue or other materials you use away with you once you’re done.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>3. Dogs</h3>
<p>Many walkers may like to bring their furry friends with them on their adventures - because there’s nothing a dog likes more than a walk! But even your pooch isn’t exempt from walking etiquette and expectations, so always hike on dog-friendly trails and pay attention to signs which may signal leash-only dogs are allowed.</p>
<p>If off-lead, ensure your dogs do not bother any wildlife or fellow walkers, and do not let them trample on flora.</p>
<p>Always clean up after your dog and do not leave poo bags around the trail (even if you intend on picking them back up on the way out).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4. Cairns</h3>
<p>Cairns are small piles of stones stacked together to show walkers the correct way to proceed along a trail, if it’s not already clear.</p>
<p>They’re somewhat controversial amongst walking communities, with some finding them useful and others finding them to be a blemish on the landscape, however some walkers will want to add to the cairn as they pass it. General walking etiquette is not to do this.</p>
<p>Adding to the tower can cause it to collapse and could end up leading walkers in the wrong direction, so it's best to leave any cairns you come across as they are.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>5. Campfires</h3>
<p>While it might seem like a lovely idea, lighting a campfire while out on a hike will be subject to fire regulations in the area you’re walking in. In locations where there are fire risks or ongoing droughts for example, they’ll likely be banned, so always be sure to check before getting out any matches. In areas where they are permitted, be sure to use an official campfire ring - this will reduce the risk of the fire escaping and causing a larger forest fire.<br /><br /><br /></p>
<h3>6. Leave No Trace</h3>
<p><br />Practicing the Leave No Trace etiquette is one of the best ways to keep any trail you’re walking on in the best condition possible. The Leave No Trace principle is to ensure that anything you bring into the environment, you are also bringing out - and making sure you’re leaving no trace (or as little trace as possible) of you being on the trail once you’ve left.<br /><br /><br /></p>
<h3>7. Music</h3>
<p>Lots of walkers will head out on to trails for some well-needed solitude, peace and to soak up the sounds of nature. It’s therefore frowned upon to listen to music while out hiking, to avoid disturbing fellow walkers and or the wildlife in the area who may communicate. Try to avoid using headphones too, so that you can stay alert to any warnings or dangers in our environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>8. General Friendliness</h3>
<p>Finally, it is great walking etiquette to generally treat other walkers with kindness, friendliness and respect. Don’t make any walker feel unwelcome, or hike too close to surrounding ramblers. Great friends and communities can be made from similar-minded people who love to walk - so there’s no reason why you can’t also make friends while out on your next adventure!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Strange" style="text-align: left;">The World's Strangest Walking Etiquette Rules</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13099496/picture-4-report-1.jpg" alt="Walking Etiquette" data-udi="umb://media/20ec8b1485404576b2cc8294f0b89be3" /></p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered some of the world’s most universally practiced walking etiquettes, we also wanted to uncover some of the strangest walking rules from around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>No Nude Hiking In Switzerland</h3>
<p>While most walkers probably wouldn’t generally consider taking their next hike in the nude, ramblers really shouldn’t walk naked in Switzerland - where the act of hiking in the nude was once a frequent occurrence and was subsequently banned. While hiking in the nude isn’t specifically illegal in other countries, it’s generally not approved of in most places - so we’d advise to cover up with your favourite leggings and walking fleece instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Don’t Kill Bigfoot!</h3>
<p>Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a large, hairy, humanlike creature which is believed by some people to exist in woodland areas in the northwestern United States and western Canada. If hikers to ever happen to find Bigfoot, and by chance are walking in Skamania County, Washington - it is not advisable to kill the creature, as doing so could land you with a year in prison.</p>

<h3>No Howling in Yellowstone</h3>
<p>If walkers are visiting Yellowstone National Park, one strange rule is that howling is strictly prohibited - as is imitating the elk which inhabit the park. While this may seem strange, the aim of this rule is to protect both visitors and wildlife by leaving the animals to thrive undisturbed by noisy walkers.</p>

<h3>Take No Shortcuts In California</h3>
<p>In two Californian national parks (Sequoia and Kings Canyon) a bizarre walking rule prohibits visitors from taking shortcuts on their trails. Any walkers tempted to go off-trail for a shorter route may risk causing serious ecological damage, and fines and punishment if caught doing so. Any walkers in the Californian National Parks should therefore be prepared to take the full route!</p>

<h3>Do Not Approach Patou Dogs In France</h3>
<p>If taking a walking trip in France, Harvey Herridge, our resident walking expert based in La Clusaz warn against approaching the ‘patou’ - also known as Pyrenean Mountain dogs.</p>
<p>“No matter their behaviour, do not approach the patou. These dogs have been brought up as working animals since the reintroduction of wolves in the French Alps. They grow up in the pastures with their flock of sheep and their job is to ward off any potential intruders. They are defensive rather than aggressive and will expect you to stay on the paths they are used to seeing humans on” Harvey comments.</p>
<p>If you spot a patou out on the trail, avoid making eye contact with it, despite how cute they can look, in order to avoid being seen as ‘challenging’ them.</p>

<h3>Ischgl, Austria</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13099495/picture-5-report-1.jpg" alt="walking etiquette report" data-udi="umb://media/51e32ab9e4ab4f8c82282a0fd2cfab7c" /></p>

Located in the picturesque Paznaun Valley and surrounded by the majestic Silvretta mountains, the area offers both leisurely strolls and high alpine trails which reach heights of nearly 3,000 metres - perfect for the outdoors adventurer.</p>

<h3>Madeira, <span>Caniço</span></h3>
<p><img src="/media/13099494/picture-6-report-1.jpg" alt="Walking Madeira" data-udi="umb://media/f400a46610f64e63a82f98733f82d85e" /></p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/f6d745a0efdf44b5b28bcd4bee55dbb1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f6d745a0efdf44b5b28bcd4bee55dbb1}" title="Canico"><span>Caniço, Madeira</span></a> offers a laid-back bolthole for exploring the beautiful Madeira - and the perfect location for outdoor lovers looking for a peaceful break.</p>
<p>As a much quieter alternative to <a data-udi="umb://document/cad35d37f73d435087041e35025d1da8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cad35d37f73d435087041e35025d1da8}" title="Funchal">Funchal</a>, the city provides opportunities for water sports (a real hotspot for divers), as well as providing lots of scenic walks. One of the most popular walks is to stroll along the Levadas - man-made channels which were initially created to carry water for the irrigation of agricultural fields around the island but are now open to walkers and outdoors lovers looking to explore the island.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bovec, Slovenia</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13099493/picture-7-report-1.jpg" alt="Slovenia Walking" data-udi="umb://media/3a351bb0f34640f8b7ba4988d38a24f5" /></p>
<p>The picturesque village of<a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/slovenia/bovec"> Bovec in Slovenia</a> lies between the mountains and rivers of the Julian Alps on the doorstep of the Triglav National Park. The area provides lots of opportunities for exploring for every kind of nature lover, cyclist, canoeist and walker of all levels.</p>
<p>Whether you want to take a leisurely stroll through the village admiring its Gothic churches and traditional local houses or take a hike up to the valleys or around the three crystal-clear lakes of Kriz - there’s so much to see and do in this hidden gem of Slovenia.</p>
<p>Our Slovenian walking expert Katja Bobnar reveals a particularly beautiful spot which is beloved amongst locals.</p>
<p>“Instead of heading to Slemenova Spica at the top of the Vrsic, do the Mavrinc walk instead. It is well known to locals with one of the best views in the area - although this trail is probably more suited to more experienced walkers. The great thing about the Mavrinc walk is that it is still quiet in the summer with great views over the pastures towards the Julian Alps.”</p>
