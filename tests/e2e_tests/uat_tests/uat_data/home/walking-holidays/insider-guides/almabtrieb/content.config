  <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>Welcome the Cows Home: Almabtrieb in Austria</h2>
<p>Almabtrieb is a festival that rolls across the mountains of Tirol in September – and it's one of our favourite events.</p>
<p>Something about the spectacle – the colours, the sounds, the happy energy – just makes you smile. But like everything in Austrian traditional culture, it all has a purpose underlying the festivities.</p>
<p>The Almabtrieb is a celebratory cattle procession marking the cows' return from their summer mountain pastures.</p>
<p>This vibrant tradition celebrates a successful grazing season with colourful decorations and the joyful clanging of cowbells to ward off bad spirits.</p>
<p>Almabtrieb celebrations can be found throughout Austria, but if you want to experience the heart of this tradition, head to Tirol.</p>
<p>The festivities happen on various weekends across the region, with most villages hosting 3 or 4 days of activities surrounding the main cow drive.</p>
<p>It's the perfect opportunity for a long weekend escape filled with Austrian charm! Need help deciding where to go? Check out Zillertal's website for a full list of events in the Tirol region.</p>
<h3>What is Almabtrieb?</h3>
<p>The word "Almabtrieb" literally means "driving down the mountain." This vibrant tradition is when farmers lead their herds – dressed in elaborate floral headdresses, ribbons, and bells – down the slopes and into their villages.</p>
<p>The most breathtaking sight is the cattle adorned in their festive best. Imagine intricate headdresses woven with vibrant flowers and evergreens from the high meadows, accented with gleaming ribbons and mirrors.</p>
<p>The cheerful ringing of their cowbells isn't just for show – it's a tradition meant to ward off evil spirits on their descent into the valley.</p>
<p>As they march down from the mountain into the village, they are accompanied by the farmers in traditional Dirndl and Lederhosen, and the closer you get to the village the more festive things become.</p>
<p>Each village has a unique 'dorf fest' (village festival) to welcome those hardworking cows back to their winter homes.</p>
<p>It's a big, cheerful farmer's party – and who doesn't love a good party? It's a visual spectacle that turns mountain towns into festive hubs buzzing with music, dancing, local crafts, and delicious food from morning to night.</p>
<p>Most villages have food stalls run by the farmers themselves, so prepare your tastebuds for the freshest cheese and meats you'll ever have. And don't miss the "Auszochne Nudeln" – fried dough pockets stuffed with cheese and herbs. Trust us, they're utterly delicious.</p>
<p>Grab a stein of beer or local wine, get a prime bench spot, and soak up the traditional Tyrolean vibes. Kids can run wild, and adults... well, let's just say there's plenty of room for a little dancing.</p>

<p>Here are a few of our favourite Almabtreib celebrations...</p>
<p>Achensee Almabtriebsfeste, Pertisau Towards the middle of September, villages around Achensee spring to life as they prepare for the annual cattle drive celebrations. Central Pertisau is a great location from which to witness many of these events, and it also hosts its own Almabtrieb with live music and a crafts market. The cows enjoy particularly pleasant summers at the beautifully situated Gramaialm above Pertisau. Visitors to the Gramaialm cattle drive also have a wonderful time! The celebrations kick off in front of Alpengenusshof Gramai with a festive brunch (and cold beer, of course), music, and a farmer's market. At midday, the journey down to the valley and Pertisau begins, where the animals and dairymen are welcomed with more live music.
