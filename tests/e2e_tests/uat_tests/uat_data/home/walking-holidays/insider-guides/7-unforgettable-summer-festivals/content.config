Enjoy a whole week of end-of-summer festivities. Sample some of the best cuisine and drink that Tirol has to offer, enjoy music, hiking and the Almfestmarket. <br /><br />Local farmers and produce merchants line the streets of the villages with stalls and decorations to celebrate this event.

Not every day do you witness a carnival of cows wearing bright coloured hats! <br /><strong><br />Inghams recommends: </strong>Make the most of the Almabtrieb festival from the comfort of the <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/austria/austrian-tyrol/soll/hotel-eggerwirt" title="Hotel Eggerwirt">Hotel Eggerwirt</a> in Söll.
