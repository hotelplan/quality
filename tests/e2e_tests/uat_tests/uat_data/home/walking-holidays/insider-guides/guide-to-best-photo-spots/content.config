Krimml Waterfalls in Zell am See, Austria </span><br /><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064736/_0004_photoingatigs1526jun15.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/c846c861b2d24fe98209c59799d46030" /><br /><br />Standing at 380metres high, the Krimml Waterfall is Europe’s highest waterfall, and the 5th highest waterfall in the world. The waterfall itself is tiered down the mountain, therefore you can capture some amazing photos from the hiking trail, which gets very close to this natural spectacle. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there: </strong>You can either go for a hike for there are many trails and routes that lead past the waterfalls, <br />OR<br />You go in one of the trains of ‘Pinzgauer Lokalbahn’, or in the Postbus from Zell am See to Kaprun. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip:</strong> Pack a raincoat! The waterfall has the tendency to spray. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong>Stay at the lovely <a href="/{localLink:8df5a8d7-56e0-4513-aa1c-34a5ac2dbcdb}" title="Hotel Heitzmann">Hotel Heitzmann</a> in <a href="/{localLink:0f1622af-4524-4a45-9a4d-92b29d807024}" title="Zell am See">Zell am See</a>, where you can expect a warm welcome from Rudi and his family.<br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

<p><span id="2" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">2. ‘The Five Fingers’ viewing platform at Dachstein, Austria<br /></span><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064750/_0009_5fingers-c-dachstein-tourismus-ag-leo-himsl-10.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/03b39b63798a471a81cf227be6aa77e7" /><br /><em> © Dachstein Tourismus AG </em><br /><br />Sitting at a staggering 500m above the ground is the world famous ‘Five Fingers’ viewing platform! Shaped like a hand, the five fingers of the platform stick out over the threshold of the cliff, so this is definitely not one for the faint hearted! <br /><br />Enjoy panoramic views across the World Heritage Region, this is a perfect opportunity to capture some jaw dropping pictures. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there:</strong> Just a short 15 minute walk from the top of the Dachstein Krippenstein cable car: the base station of this gondola can be reached by Postbus from Obertraun. Obertraun has an easily accessible train station. <strong><br /><br />Inghams recommends: </strong>Pull up a seat on the beautiful sun terrace outside the <a href="/{localLink:805897c5-8eaa-4b03-8f11-20678caf73d3}" title="Hotel Hanneshof">Hotel Hanneshof</a> in <a href="/{localLink:7cd756f3-77ae-406f-9f3f-a6b230c23f21}" title="Filzmoos">Filzmoos</a> and enjoy a coffee whilst you watch the world go by.<br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

The Mittelallalin in Saas-Fee, Switzerland </span> <br /><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064746/_0007_drehrestaurant.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/1e5c23e9fba74377a270d585438d3aa6" /><br /><em> © Saas-Fee Tourist Board </em><br /><br />The Mittelallalin in Saas-Fee is one of the highest revolving cafe/restaurants in the world. Standing at 3,500m, the Threesixty offers fantastic views over the glacier and a very unique dining experience! <br /><br />Impressive views across the Saas valley and over the surrounding peaks of the Swiss Alps, if you don’t fancy stopping for a bite to eat, the summit station of the Metro Alpin underground funicular is surrounded by viewing stations. <br /><strong><br />Getting there:</strong> From Saas-Fee, walk to the base of the gondola station (about 5-10 minutes) and hop on the ‘Alpin Express’ gondola. <br />At the midway station, ‘Morenia’, you change to another gondola, ending at ‘Felskinn’. From here, catch the underground funicular train called the ‘Metro Alpin’ which will take you to Mittelallalin. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong>The recently refurbished <a href="/{localLink:03b01fe2-4907-450a-b0c7-4c7bb91e6e1d}" title="Hotel Dom">Hotel Dom</a> in <a href="/{localLink:0984c643-7643-4293-9984-94c6c14147eb}" title="Saas Fee">Saas-Fee</a> is the oldest hotel in the town therefore the architecture both internally and externally tells a great tale. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

<p><span id="4" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;"><a name="baldo" class="mceItemAnchor"></a>4. Mount Baldo in Lake Garda, Italy<br /><br /></span><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064739/_0005_lm_mac_gen_c11.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/6444179e1bea40809b2fc715e0e662c8" /><br /><br />Another not-to-miss experience is riding the Malcesine gondola to the top of Monte Baldo on the edge of <a href="/{localLink:4dfa5c28-2dfc-4dba-89e7-f34d65bc2f26}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, in Italy. The cable car rotates 360° during its 10 minute and 1600m ascent of the side of the Baldo mountain, making the journey as astounding as the view from the top itself. <br /><br />Our Inghams expert, Ilenia, promises that the views from the summit of the mountain are definitely photo-worthy. On a clear day you can see the whole of Lake Garda from Riva to Peschiera del Garda! <br /><br /><strong>Getting there: </strong>The Funivia Malscesine gondola is extremely well located and can be reached by foot from the centre of Malscesine. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip: </strong>The Funivia Malscesine is extremely popular in the summer months, so aim to get there before 10:00. Also be prepared for a little stroll when you get to the top! <strong><br /><br />Inghams recommends: </strong>For something a bit different, we would recommend staying at the <a href="/{localLink:03cc3625-2888-457a-ae86-437039dde530}" title="Bellevue San Lorenzo Hotel">Hotel Bellevue San Lorenzo</a> which was once six traditional Italian villas but has now been converted into this picturesque hotel. The hotel is a 20 minute walk away from the Funivia Malscesine. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

<p><span id="5" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">5. The Greenway Walk in Lake Como, Italy</span> <br /><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064733/_0003_photoingitbes1507jul15.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/5f92612903ec42709bfd67fac53879ac" /><br /><br />For those who fancy slipping in a bit of exercise along their photography adventure, this is the walk for you. An easy 10km that runs along the shore of <a href="/{localLink:09b67bca-75b4-4d3d-a333-b4075d9daca0}" title="Lake Como">Lake Como</a> in Italy, arguably one of the most beautiful and scenic lakes the country has to offer. <br /><br />The walk runs past stately Italian houses, peaceful and secluded woodland and paths that run along the side of the lake. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there: </strong>You can get the boat from Bellagio (and many other towns and villages around Lake Como) to Griante, near Cadenabbia. The walk commences from there. <br /><br /><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Make sure you wear some ‘broken in’ walking shoes for this walk, as it spans 10km (roughly 2 hours walking). Nothing is worse than the ‘new boot’ blister! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends</strong>: The <a href="/{localLink:4b6ae801-bb49-42bc-8c52-d64e24b6c536}" title="Hotel Belvedere">Hotel Belvedere</a> is ideally located above the village of Bellagio, across the lake from Griante, offering stunning views across the lake. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

<p><span id="6" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">6. Bürgenstock in Lucerne, Switzerland</span> <br /><br /><br /><br />Described as looking like a ‘heaven bound rocket’, the 150m high lift to the Bürgenstock is Europe’s highest vertical outdoor lift, and the viewing platform at the top offers remarkable views across Lake Lucerne and the surrounding mountains.<br /><br />If you don’t fancy the dizzying ascent of the mountain side in the Hammetschwand Elevator, then there is always the much easier trip up the nearby Bürgenstockbahn (Bürgenstock Railway) to the summit. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there:</strong> There is a variety of different methods for getting to the base of the Bürgenstock Hammetschwand elevator (and the Bürgenstock summit itself), including boat connections across <a href="/{localLink:299794f0-978a-4293-afdb-4548abb07e6e}" title="Lake Lucerne">Lake Lucerne</a>, and a pre-booked bus that runs from Stansstad to the summit during the summer months. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip:</strong> Bürgenstock is currently undergoing lots of transformations and restorations. The full resort should be complete in 2017. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong> If you’re looking for a cosy atmosphere head to <a href="/{localLink:1b0c7fbe-a267-4ba0-a063-dfd464a5312d}" title="Hotel Central Am See (Weggis)">Hotel Central am See</a> which is situated right on the lake front, across the lake from the Bürgenstock mountain and Hammetschwand Elevator. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

A beautiful scenic walk back into Mayrhofen will bring you plenty more photographs to share with your friends and family back home. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> The <a href="/{localLink:87a56f5d-d54d-4b62-aa29-3c27b4cbb469}" title="Hotel Strass">Hotel Strass</a> is one of our most popular hotels in <a href="/{localLink:efc42ed0-4c56-4f0f-a127-f0dfa59ded94}" title="Mayrhofen">Mayrhofen</a>, due to its great central location, local cuisine and friendly staff. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

There you can get your snaps of the view across the Jungfrau skin region. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there: </strong> Conveniently, the Mürren-Schilthorn gondola runs from the very centre of Mürren and up to the summit. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip: </strong> Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get a photo of yourself and your travelling partners against the iconic backdrop of the three legendary peaks: the Jungfrau, Mönch and Eiger! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> Guests staying with us at the <a href="/{localLink:1816ec87-52c3-4a43-9f8b-f69f4423086a}" title="Hotel Alpenruh">Hotel Alpenruh</a> in <a href="/{localLink:d99a621f-250b-4e65-b842-73aa38f7d927}" title="Murren">Mürren</a> couldn’t be in a better position to hop on the Schilthorn as it is located adjacent to the hotel, perfect!   <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

Grab the boat to this secluded island and enjoy walking about in the traffic-free streets. The buildings here are centuries old, with beautiful paved streets and immaculate murals painted on the insides of churches, this is a real Italian haven. <br /><br />Walk around the island (a mere 2km) and enjoy the isolation while you can! <br /><br /><strong>Getting there:</strong> Easiest place to catch the ferry to Isola Maggiore is from Tuoro Sul Trasimeno, a short ride across the lake will bring you to the medieval village on the island. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip: </strong> Don’t be afraid to duck your heads into churches on the island, but be wary about taking photographs without permission. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> Stay at the <a href="/{localLink:efda4130-d953-4698-90e2-6618c8f67ecf}" title="Hotel Lido, Passignano">Hotel Lido</a> and request a room with a balcony view over the lake to admire the stunning sunsets. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

But what makes this viewing platform so special? Well, for one, it can be quite hard to squeeze two majestic lakes and three epochal mountains into one view. But the view from the Two Lakes Viewing Platform does all this. <br /><br />Enjoy the picturesque restaurant at this vantage point and make the most of the structure of footpaths and trails that start at this point and explore the mountain. <br /><br /><strong>Getting there: </strong> The Interlaken Harderbahn gondola starts on the north side of the river in <a href="/{localLink:9112a49c-ab37-4cc2-b89f-f720bee352db}" title="Interlaken">Interlaken</a>, extremely easy to access by foot from the centre of town. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip:</strong> Make the most of the end of your day by watching the sun slip beneath the mountains while you enjoy a glass of wine on the Harder Kulm restaurant terrace (subject to availability). The Harderbahn gondola will carry you back down the mountain again. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> The <a href="/{localLink:673298e4-cec5-4615-846d-0bebdbd9275a}" title="Hotel Du Lac">Hotel du Lac</a> is new to our programme for 2015, and what a great addition it is! The Interlaken Ost train station is just a few steps away making it a great base to get out and explore the Jungfrau region. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>
