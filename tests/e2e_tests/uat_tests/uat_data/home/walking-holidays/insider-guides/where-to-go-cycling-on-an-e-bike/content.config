<p>The beautiful town of <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine"><strong>Malcesine</strong></a> on Lake Garda is the ideal location for a cycling holiday. The natural beauty of Monte Baldo, which is situated near the town, has long attracted keen cyclists. The mountain has a wealth of trails letting cyclists encounter stunning scenery.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently many of these trails would have been too challenging for novice cyclists. All that changed in 2014 when Monte Baldo became the home of Italy’s first dedicated e-bike trails, the Green Bike Park.</p>
<p>There are now over 100km of cycling trails around Malcesine, and the views from Monte Baldo have become accessible to cyclists of all abilities.</p>
<p>You can explore the mountain bike routes around Malcesine by hiring bikes at the bottom of the Monte Baldo cable car for around €45 per day. Guides to show you the best routes in and around resort are available for between €40 and €60 per day.</p>

<p>With e-bike rental, charging stations and guided e-bike tours, the town of <a data-udi="umb://document/a71713291d5d4220aea1b806f34cd053" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a71713291d5d4220aea1b806f34cd053}" title="Seefeld"><strong>Seefeld</strong></a> is exceptionally set-up for e-bikers. The local tourist office provides a number of recommendations for routes you can follow on an e-bike.</p>
<p>Route 13 takes cyclists from the centre of Seefeld to the Moserer See lake and back via the famous Wildmoosalm. Make sure you stop off en route at the Möserer Seestub’n mountain restaurant where there is a free e-bike charging station. It is a gentle route and, at full pelt, takes little over one and a half hours to complete.</p>
<p>Slightly tougher is the route between Seefeld and Rosshütte (Route 31). Climbing 580m, the trail may seem intimidating but it’s thoroughly worth it. The Bergrestaurant Rosshütte, at the end of the trail, provides spectacular views over the Seefeld high plateau. The terrace is a great lunch spot, and while you recharge your energy, you can recharge your e-bike too!</p>
<p>You can rent city style e-bikes from hire shops and some hotels for approximately €25 per day, while mountain e-bikes will cost you around €35 per day. Walking maps also show the major cycling routes and e-bike tours can be booked locally.</p>
