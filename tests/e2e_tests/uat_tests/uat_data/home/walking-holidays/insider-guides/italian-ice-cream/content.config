<h2>What Is an Italian Ice Cream Called?</h2>
<p>Gelato is a special kind of Italian ice cream. Although "gelato" means "ice cream" in Italian, it's a bit different from the ice cream you might be used to. Gelato is creamier and smoother.</p>
<p>This is because it has much less air mixed in, making it denser and allowing it to have a stronger taste. So, when you eat gelato, you're getting a richer flavour in every scoop.</p>

<h3>A Scoop Above The Rest</h3>
<p>Italian gelato is celebrated around the globe for its lush, creamy consistency and vibrant flavours, with the finest examples naturally found in Italy itself.</p>
<p>Gelato is considered a fancier, handmade version of regular ice cream, mainly because of what it's made from. This is what gives gelato its unique flavour and smoother texture compared to ordinary ice cream.</p>

<p>It's the perfect choice whether you're relaxing after a long hike or just exploring new tastes. On a sunny day, there's nothing better than indulging in a scoop of Italian ice cream.</p>
<p>A balanced diet in Italy? An ice cream in each hand.</p>

<h2>Types of Italian Icecream</h2>
<p>Italy is famous for its gelato, offering classic flavours you'll find everywhere, along with special seasonal ones that are too tempting not to try. It's a colourful mix of so many tastes and textures, each one shouting, "Pick me!"</p>
<p>Do you go with a classic flavour like Chocolate or try something new like Mango?</p>
<p>Apparently the most popular flavours worldwide are vanilla and chocolate. But Italian ice cream, or gelato, offers a rainbow of unique and exciting flavours that you won't find anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate</strong> (Cioccolato): Chocolate gelato is a favorite in Italy, with many types to choose from. Whether you prefer creamy milk chocolate (Cioccolato al latte), rich dark chocolate (Cioccolato Fondente), or extra-dark, there's a chocolate gelato for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Strawberry</strong> (Fragola): A refreshing favourite, fragola gelato is the taste of summer. Made with fresh strawberries and either water or milk, this fruity gelato is perfect for cooling down on a hot day.</p>
<p><strong>Lemon</strong> (Limone):Limone gelato gives a zesty and refreshing taste, ideal for anyone craving a light treat. Made with real lemon, it's a burst of citrusy goodness that's sure to tantalise your taste buds.</p>
<p><strong>Mint Chocolate Chip</strong> (Menta): Menta gelato, also known as "Cioccomenta," combines the cool freshness of mint with the indulgent richness of chocolate chips, a bit like the popular ‘After Eight’ chocolates. If you love mint chocolate then this one's for you.</p>
<p><strong>Stracciatella</strong>: Another classic Italian gelato flavour, stracciatella features creamy milk gelato with delicate chocolate shavings.</p>
<p><strong>Bacio</strong>: Named after the Italian word for "kiss," bacio gelato is a fusion of hazelnut and chocolate flavours. It’s a delicious combination of creamy gelato and crunchy hazelnut pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Milk</strong> (Fior di Latte): Fior di Latte gelato offers a simple yet satisfying taste of pure milk and sugar, showcasing the essence of traditional Italian gelato-making. It's a timeless favourite for those who prefer the simple flavours.</p>
<p><strong>Pistachio</strong> (Pistacchio): With its vibrant green hue and rich pistachio flavour, pistacchio gelato is a beloved Italian classic.</p>
<p><strong>Hazelnut</strong> (Nocciola): Nocciola gelato delights with its creamy texture and nutty flavour. It's a deliciously versatile option that's perfect for any summer day.</p>
<p><strong>Tiramisù</strong>: A quintessential Italian dessert, tiramisù gelato features the irresistible combination of coffee and mascarpone.</p>
<p>In artisan gelato shops, the flavours vary daily, showcasing the freshest seasonal ingredients and latest trends.</p>
<p>Some avant-garde spots feature uniquely creative flavours, so prepare for surprises. Look for a board or sign listing the day's flavors, usually divided into traditional gelato and dairy-free sorbets, often fruit-based and equally delicious.</p>

<h2>How is Gelato Served?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13103196/adobestock_69594093.jpg" alt="Italian icecream" data-udi="umb://media/ab92039ae2ab4766956cac5b44f0d6ee" /></p>
<p>Gelato comes in various sizes, from small to extra-large, served in cups or cones. The smallest size offers 1 or 2 flavours, medium has 3, and large has 4 or more.</p>
<p>Expert gelato makers use a special spatula to scoop the perfect dollop onto your cone or into your cup, making it easier to serve.</p>
<p>Some gelaterias prefer serving only cups, while others offer artisanal cones for a better taste experience.</p>
<p>You might be offered the option to dip your cone in chocolate or roll it in nuts for an extra treat.</p>
<p>If you choose a cup, you'll get a small plastic spoon, and some places add a wafer cookie on top of your cone for extra sweetness.</p>

<p>These beloved gelato houses are easy to spot - the lines stretch out the door and down the cobblestone streets.</p>
<p>It's a tourist attraction you’ll really want to see. Here, gelato is crafted with the utmost care.</p>
<p>Gelato: because even in Italy, icecream is a work of art.</p>
