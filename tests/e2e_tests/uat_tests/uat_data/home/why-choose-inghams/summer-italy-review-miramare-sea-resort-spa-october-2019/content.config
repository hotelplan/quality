  <description><![CDATA[Just loved this break. SantAngelo on Ischia is the perfect destination for a most relaxing holiday.  The hotel was excellent, our room had a panoramic sea view, the food delicious and plentiful and every member of staff did their very best to make our holiday memorable. Our travel arrangements, transfers, ferry crossings and pickups all went very smoothly. We will certainly be making a return trip.]]></description>
