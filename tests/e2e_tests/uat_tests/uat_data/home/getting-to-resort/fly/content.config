<h2>Airport parking &amp; hotels</h2>
<p>Book with our partner, <a data-udi="umb://document/c1dfd7b000b545cab768de4fc23d69f3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c1dfd7b000b545cab768de4fc23d69f3}" title="Airport Parking Hotels &amp; Lounges">APH Airport Parking &amp; Hotels</a> and <strong>get up to 35% discount</strong> at all UK Airports, Airport Hotel Offers from only £35 per person including FREE parking or Meet and Greet valet parking at Airports from only £45. For further information and online booking, see <a data-udi="umb://document/c1dfd7b000b545cab768de4fc23d69f3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c1dfd7b000b545cab768de4fc23d69f3}" title="Airport Parking Hotels &amp; Lounges">APH Airport Parking &amp; Hotels</a></p>
<h2>Checking in</h2>
<p>Check-in desks open <strong>approximately 2-3 hours </strong>prior to departure and we recommend you check-in at least 2 hours before. Each passenger must check-in their own luggage as this is an important security check. You will need to produce your e-tickets and passports (e-tickets are checked against passports) and have your baggage weighed. Most airports no longer call out flight boarding details so you must watch the indicator board and individual TV monitors. Inghams cannot accept any responsibility for passengers who miss flights if they fail to check-in at the specified time shown on flight tickets.</p>
<h2>Online Check-in</h2>
<p>Online check-in is now available on some of our scheduled flights to Europe and North America. We will provide you with an airline locator with your e-tickets approximately 2 weeks before you travel. You will then be able to access your booking via your airline's website 24 hours before departure and pre-book your seats or check-in online.</p>
<p>Online check-in is also not available with any of our charter airlines or low cost carriers. Where seats have been pre-booked on our charter services, exact seat numbers will be provided to you at check-in.</p>
<h2>Luggage and Excess Baggage</h2>
<p>Due to weight and volume restrictions, our airline partners impose the following baggage allowances per person.</p>
<h4>Charter flights</h4>
<p>Normally 15-20kg per person (excluding infants) but varies by airline. Your allowance will be shown on your e-ticket.</p>
<h2>Low Cost scheduled flights</h2>
<p>Carriage of one piece of baggage will automatically be reserved for you.</p>
<h2>Other scheduled flights (Europe &amp; Canada)</h2>
<p>1 piece per person weighing up to 20kg (23kg on British Airways). <br />BA Club Europe &amp; World Traveller Plus and Club World have an allowance of 2 pieces per person.</p>
<p>All airlines (including charter carriers) now strictly enforce these limits and will charge for excess baggage, either per kilo or by extra piece. Please check the airlines' websites for the most up-to-date information regarding baggage allowances.<br /><br /><strong>Please note:</strong> All baggage restrictions are implemented and enforced by the airline - Inghams does not charge (or receive any revenue) for excess baggage.</p>
<h2>Hand Luggage</h2>
<p>Passengers (excluding infants) are allowed to carry ONE piece of cabin baggage on board free of charge. Handbag, briefcase, laptops, etc must be carried within your permitted 1 piece of cabin baggage. It should weigh no more than 5kg and not exceed the maximum dimensions of 55cm x 40cm x 20cm. As a guide, your carry-on bag must be able to fit either underneath the seat or in the overhead compartment.</p>
<p>Due to ongoing security restrictions, only liquids in containers of 100mls or less will be permitted through the passenger security screening points. Liquid items must be carried in a transparent re-sealable bag (about the size of a small freezer bag).</p>
<h2>Pre-book your Seating Arrangements</h2>
<p>To ensure your party sits together, you can pre-book seats on many of our featured airlines. Full details and any applicable charges for each participating airline will be sent with your travel details. Please note that seats may be separated by an aisle due to aircraft configurations. Exact seat numbers are given at check-in. Should we cancel or change your airline to one that is not part of this scheme, we will of course issue a full refund.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.austrian.com/Info/AustrianServices/SeatCategoryGuarantee.aspx" target="_blank">Pre-book your seats</a>* with Austrian Airlines up to 48 hours before departure on their website. Your contract for this service is between you and Austrian Airlines, not Inghams.<br />*Austrian charge for this service and any issues must be directed to them.</p>
<h2>Essential Medicines</h2>
<p>Essential medicines and medical equipment, eg hypodermic needles required for your holiday may be permitted onboard in larger quantities above the 100ml limit. Passengers must have a note from their GP supporting this.</p>
<h3>In-flight Catering</h3>
<p>Please check your flight tickets for full details. Meals are served on all transatlantic services. On most short-haul services within Europe a "Buy on Board" service is now offered.</p>
<h2><strong>Baby Food</strong></h2>
<p>Liquid baby food or sterilised water, sufficient for the journey, can be taken through airport security. The accompanying adult may be required to verify by tasting.</p>
<h2>Flight Supplements</h2>
<p><strong>Charter &amp; Low Cost scheduled flights</strong></p>
<p>Flight supplements may apply on certain dates and routes. You will be advised of the actual price at the time of booking.</p>
<p><strong>Other scheduled flights</strong></p>
<p>Most scheduled airlines have several different 'booking classes' for the same seat. Depending on such factors as aircraft size, day/time of departure, a variable number of seats will be available in each booking class. Airlines operate sophisticated yield management systems and are constantly updating availability and prices. Our reservations system checks for the most up-to-date position. You may therefore be offered different supplements at different times. If you book early you have the best chance of obtaining the lowest price economy class seat.</p>
<h2>Flight Upgrades</h2>
<p>If you're flying, you can upgrade to Club Class on our British Airways flights to many European and Canadian destinations, which ensures a greater luggage allowance, more legroom and dedicated check-in desks to avoid the airport queues.</p>

<h3>Advanced Passenger Information (API)</h3>
<p>The UK Government requires airlines to collect API for passengers on routes to and from the UK. Airlines will only provide each country's authorities with the relevant information required by them. However, some governments also require airlines to provide them with Passenger Name Records (PNR). Governments of some other countries also require API.</p>
<p>For most countries, API is restricted to the standard information contained in the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) in machine-readable passports which can be scanned or swiped at airport check-in and transmitted to the country concerned at the time the aircraft departs. However, some countries are now requiring additional information from passengers that isn't contained in passports, or they are requiring it earlier or both. We are legally required to collect your advance passenger information. You will receive further information before your departure when and how we need to collect your details.</p>
<p>Please note that any failure to provide the required information may result in your carriage being denied. Please be assured that we have measures in place to protect the personal information you provide us (please see our <a data-udi="umb://document/744254e89e86433d968483868600b482" href="/{localLink:umb://document/744254e89e86433d968483868600b482}" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>).</p>

As availability and prices will vary according to the date of travel and the time of booking, please see our <a href="/flight-only/late-deals/">flights only</a> page for the latest up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Flight-only passengers may also book car hire or coach transfers to and from our featured resorts if required. Please note that coaches run to/from featured Inghams accommodation only, and please use the price panels on our resort pages to check that your preferred resort is indeed served by the flight you have chosen.</p>
<h3>Private Transfers</h3>
<p>Private Transfers are also available for the ultimate speed and convenience, and you can pre-book a private taxi transfer with us from the airport to your hotel. We offer private taxi transfers to groups of two to six people booking a full package with accommodation. Prices are shown in the table to the right. If your group is larger than six people, please contact us for a quote. You can book a private transfer up to 14 days before departure, but we recommend you confirm this at time of booking to ensure it is reserved for you.</p>
<h3>Transfers to your resort</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transfer to your accommodation from the airport is normally by coach, except in Switzerland and Constance. Occasionally this will be by or include transport by minibus, taxi, train or boat. Guests travelling to different resorts may be on the same coach, and the transfer itinerary may include dropping off guests at resorts en route.</li>
<li>Approximate distances and transfer times from overseas airports to resorts (excl. time at the airport) are shown on each resort page. Journey times may vary due to traffic and weather conditions. Times given are only a guide.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to wait for guests arriving on other flights, but we try to keep waiting time to a minimum.</li>
<li>In a few Austrian/Italian resorts it may not be possible for the coach to reach the hotel due to the layout of the resort centre. We will try to arrange for the hotels to send a taxi/minibus to collect you and/or your luggage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transfers and Travel in Switzerland</h3>
<p><strong>Transfers to Swiss Resorts and Lake Constance</strong><br />Transfers in Switzerland via Zurich and Geneva airports are by train, using the excellent Swiss Federal and mountain railways. Your journey may involve changes of trains, and some transfers also involve travel by a local bus, boat or cable car. Zurich and Geneva have railway stations within the airport. Onward transfers within resorts to/from your accommodation are included by taxi/minibus/bus where necessary. Swiss trains, railway stations etc operate a ‘no-smoking’ policy. Some competitors charge<br />£115 per person for rail transfers in Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>First-class</strong><br />First-class rail tickets are available for Swiss transfers (and Constance, Germany) at a supplement:<br />• £33 Single-centre holidays<br />• £33 ‘Mont Blanc Express’ (upgrade applies on Swiss trains only from Martigny to Visp)</p>

NB Half-Price card not included for guests travelling to Lindau, Lochau &amp; Bregenz. When pre-booking a ‘Swiss Pass’, this is issued in addition to your Half-Price card &amp; resort transfer ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Fly-Luggage – Switzerland (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>Swiss Railways operate a service which enables you to send your luggage all the way from your UK airport, on check-in, to your hotel in Switzerland. This service is available to all guests flying to Geneva or Zurich airports at an extra cost of £14 per item each way. Please purchase at time of booking.</p>
<p><strong>Outward journey</strong></p>
<p>• Check-in your luggage at your UK airport, with fly-rail baggage label attached.<br />• Please note: Your luggage will normally arrive at your hotel the morning after you arrive in Switzerland, so it is vital that you carry an overnight bag with you with all    essentials.<br />• Luggage will arrive in resort at the railway station and be collected and brought to your accommodation for you by your Inghams representative (system varies by resort).</p>
<p><strong>Homeward journey</strong></p>
<p>• Luggage normally needs to be sent from your Swiss resort back to the airport the day before your flight home. Your Inghams representative will arrange this for you.<br />• Please note: You may only be able to send your luggage as far as Geneva or Zurich airport. For security reasons you may need to collect it at the airport railway station and check-in for your flight with it as normal.<br />• If you are flying with Swiss International Airlines, you can normally send you luggage back to your UK airport without collecting it at the Swiss airport. Please note that this service is not included in the basic holiday package.</p>
<p>Two Centre and Multi-Centre Holidays<br />Luggage registration within Switzerland between centres is not included but can usually be arranged locally for a small charge, if required.</p>
