  <answer><![CDATA[<p>This can be done through your online <a href="https://my.inghams.co.uk/login">My Booking</a> or by getting in touch with Reservations on <strong><span class="InfinityNumber">01483 791 111</span></strong> or your Travel Agent.</p>
<p>We would advise you to book your extras as early as possible to secure the best deals, as many offers are subject to availability and can be withdrawn at any time. Most extras can be added up until 4 days before departure.</p>
<p>If you want to cancel pre-booked extras, this may incur an administration fee of £25 per person or even 100% loss – please contact your travel agent, or Reservations on <strong><span class="InfinityNumber">01483 791 111</span></strong>.</p>]]></answer>
