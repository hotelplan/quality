  <answer><![CDATA[<p>The party leader is responsible for ensuring all party members are in possession of a valid passport (a full 10 year passport in the case of British Citizens over the age of 16 on return date), which is valid for a minimum of 3 months after the date of return from your destination. Your passport should have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before you arrive (passports issued before 1 October 2018 may have extra months added if renewed before expiry). </p>
<p>If you are unsure if your passport has sufficient validity, you can check the requirements for your chosen destination here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice</a>.</p>
<p>Please be aware that in some instances your arrival point from the UK may differ from your final travel destination, e.g. flights into Geneva (Switzerland) for holidays in France. You will therefore need to check the travel advice for both destinations.</p>]]></answer>
