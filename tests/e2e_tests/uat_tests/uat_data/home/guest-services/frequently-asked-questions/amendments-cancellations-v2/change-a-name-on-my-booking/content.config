  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Depending on your flight, you will be charged £25 to make a name change. Please be aware that some scheduled flights will incur a much higher fee from the airline on top of the £25. Re-ticketing charges by scheduled/low cost airlines in respect of name changes will incur cancellation charges on a scale of £100 upwards. Some scheduled airlines may not permit flight or name changes. Changing all names on the booking will classify as cancellation and incur the relevant fees at the time.</p>
<p>If a date of birth or name is incorrect on your confirmation invoice, we will need to amend this, and there may be an admin charge of £25 as a result. Please be aware that changing your date of birth may affect the cost of your holiday, or any extras that you may have pre-booked, due to child and senior discounts.</p>
<p>If your title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Mstr, Ms, Dr) is incorrect on our paperwork, this will not affect your travel, as titles do not appear on passports. If you wish however for us to change your title, please call Reservations on <strong>01486 791111</strong> or your Travel Agent. Please note an admin fee will be charged to update your paperwork and any system.</p>]]></answer>
