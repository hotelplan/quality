  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Our team of Inghams’ representatives will meet you on your arrival in resort wherever possible and according to the train connections advised on your rail itinerary. Just look out for an Inghams’ sign. Very occasionally your rep will not be available to greet you. If your hotel is not within walking distance of the resort train/bus station we will organise a hotel pick-up for you.</span></p>]]></answer>
