  <answer><![CDATA[<p>In order to travel with Inghams, it is essential that every person who books with us has arranged suitable insurance from a reputable provider. Your policy should cover you from when you book, up until the day after your return to ensure that you have full coverage (including cover for cancellation before your planned holiday). Depending on your holiday plans, you should also make sure you are covered for any relevant activities you are going to take part in.</p>]]></answer>
