  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Scheduled and low cost airlines price their seats in such a way that there are a number of fare classes, this simply means that economy seats are broken out into different price brackets. As seats sell, availability moves into the next pricing bracket and the cost of that seat increases (although still in economy). As these seats are available publicly, not just to Inghams customers we have no control over the prices and / or the availability. You will be advised of the exact, additional cost of flights at the time of booking.</span></p>]]></answer>
