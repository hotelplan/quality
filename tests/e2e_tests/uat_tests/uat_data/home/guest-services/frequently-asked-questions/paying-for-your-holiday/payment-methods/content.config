<p>We accept payment using the following cards - MasterCard and Visa debit &amp; credit cards.</p>
<p>We accept electronic transfers into our Barclays bank account (a/c number - 9311 7413 and sort code 20-65-82 under the name Hotelplan Ltd Client A/C), but please ensure that your booking reference is clearly stated in the payment reference field.</p>
<p>We also accept cheque payments made payable to Hotelplan Ltd, but please note your booking reference on the reverse of the cheque so we can apply the payment to the correct booking.</p>
<p>In addition, to avoid guests inadvertently paying late and potentially incurring late payment fees, we offer a service where the remainder of your holiday balance is automatically debited from the payment card initially used should you choose to accept this. Please note that Inghams do not store your card details. These card details are retained by a separate financial company, regulated by the Financial Services Authority who ensure stringent data protection controls are in place. Please call our Credit Control team on 01483 79 11 66 if you have any other payment queries.</p>]]></answer>
