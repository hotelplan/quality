  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Yes, it is important to ensure that all members of your party have adequate travel insurance, whether travelling on a Ski &amp; Snowboard or Lakes &amp; Mountains holiday. You can add this to your booking during the online booking process. Alternatively, you will be able to book travel insurance through Inghams with FOGG Insurance at any time before departure. If you and members of your party already have a travel insurance policy, you will need to provide us with the details of this alternative cover.</span></p>]]></answer>
