  <answer><![CDATA[<p>If you need help with your bags, the Swiss Railways offer a luggage transfer service to most resorts. The ‘Fly-luggage’ service allows you to send your bags from your UK departure airport all the way to your hotel at a cost of from £14 per item per way. This may be booked with us before departure. There are 2 levels of service – ‘Standard’ and ‘Express’:</p>
<p>- On the ‘Standard’ service, luggage may not arrive in resort until the morning 2 days after you arrive, so we do not recommend sending any essentials on this service to make sure you can make the most of your time in resort! <br />- The ‘Express’ service is available from £25 per item per way for guests landing into Switzerland before 11:30am. For flights landing after 11:30am, only the ‘Standard’ service is available.</p>

<p>If you do decide to use the service, you will be sent the relevant documentation and instructions with your rail transfer tickets and rail itinerary.</p>
<p>An alternative service to transfer your luggage is via our partner ‘Luggage Mule’, who pick-up your luggage from your home a few days before you are due to travel and courier them to your end destination so they are waiting for you when you arrive. Prices start from approx. £69 per item per way, and Inghams receive a 5% discount. This must be booked directly with Luggage Mule. Please call 01618702364 for more details and to book.</p>]]></answer>
