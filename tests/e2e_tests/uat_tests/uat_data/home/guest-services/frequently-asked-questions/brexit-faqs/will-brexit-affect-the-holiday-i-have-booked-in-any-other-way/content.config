  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>No. Until the UK officially leaves the EU (which it has already been announced won’t be for at least another two years), as ABTA has confirmed, British holidaymakers are just as free to travel between the UK and the EU as they were before the vote. Also, the European Health Insurance Card remains valid, and regulations such as Air Passenger Rights and EU Package Travel Regulations all remain in place.</span></p>]]></answer>
