  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Please let our Reservations Team or your Travel Agent (as applicable) know if you have any special requests or requirements so that we can pass them on to the supplier. If you booked online with us directly, you’ll need to call us about any special requirements or requests that you may have. These are requests and are not guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility requirements:</strong><br />If there are things that are paramount to your holiday, such as (but not limited to) wheelchair assistance at the airport, walk-in shower in your accommodation, adapted rooms or transfer vehicles, you must contact us before you book so that we can send you the appropriate request form. This should be completed and returned to us before your booking is confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary requirements/requests:</strong><br />We aim to provide information on our accommodation pages about special diets that can be accommodated in our featured properties, e.g. vegan, vegetarian and dietary preferences. Please check this information when selecting your accommodation, and let us know of any requests or preferences that you have.</p>
<p>If you have a severe allergy or intolerance, i.e. where certain foodstuffs must be completely avoided, it is important that you let us know before confirming your booking with us so that we can confirm that the accommodation that you have chosen is suitable for your needs. Some of our accommodations are small, family-run establishments whose kitchens are not set-up to facilitate dedicated food preparation areas for allergens.</p>]]></answer>
