  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Yes of course! There will be many magical memories to capture and bring home to share with friends and family. However, extreme cold can adversely affect some cameras, so do check the manufacturers’ guidelines. Camera batteries also discharge very quickly in the cold, so bring plenty of spares! Also be aware of the ‘twilight’ times, when flash photography is necessary. The same goes for mobile phone batteries, so it is a good idea to bring a portable charger if you are planning to use the camera on your smart phone.</p>]]></answer>
