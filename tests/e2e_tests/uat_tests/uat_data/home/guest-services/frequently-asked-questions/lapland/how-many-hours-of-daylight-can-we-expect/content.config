  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Throughout December and the first 2 weeks in January, there are approximately 5 hours of daylight. This period is known as ‘Kaamos’ by Finnish locals, when the sun barely rises above the horizon. From mid-January to February, this increases to 6-8 hours per day. From mid-February, the daylight hours increase rapidly until March/April when there is approx. 9-15 hours per day and the sun shines on the bright white snow – it’s the perfect time for skiing and activities!</p>]]></answer>
