  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Lapland is snow-sure with snow typically arriving at the end of November. The time from the beginning of December to mid-February sees between 5 and 8 hours or daylight per day, so slope access is limited to those which are floodlit during this time. Slopes are open until late though so if you are lucky, there is the chance of skiing under the Northern Lights! The scenery and Arctic light at this time are also amazing and the powder snow is pristine with depths reaching up to 50cm. From mid-February onwards, the days are much longer and the snow is typically at its deepest up to 65cm so the full areas are open. March is a popular time with the Finns with the trails (and bars!) becoming a hive of activity during the Spring.</p>]]></answer>
