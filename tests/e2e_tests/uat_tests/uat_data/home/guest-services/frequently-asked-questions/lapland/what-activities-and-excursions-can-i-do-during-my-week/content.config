  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Besides skiing, we offer a wide range of activities for you to choose from during your stay. Staying 7 nights means you have more time to experience these and we guarantee that everything you pre-book, you will be able to do during your stay. All of our resorts offer the opportunity to do the ‘Big 3’ activities which include the snowmobile, husky and reindeer safaris. You can choose from shorter family-friendly trips or longer, faster adult-only trips. You can also try snowshoeing, visit the Snow Village, meet Santa at his workshop, take a horse sleigh ride through the forest, go horse-riding, try ice fishing or even go fat-biking.
