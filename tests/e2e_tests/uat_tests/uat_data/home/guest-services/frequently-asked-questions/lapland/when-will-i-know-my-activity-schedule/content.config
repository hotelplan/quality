  <answer><![CDATA[<p>As our activity times can change week by week, we are not able to confirm the exact time of each pre-booked activity before travel. Your activity planner will be issued to you on arrival in Lapland. If you have a preferred time or day for a particular activity, we are happy to take requests but as we try and accommodate as many requests as possible, we cannot guarantee your request will be possible. However, all of our excursions are exclusively reserved for Inghams’ guests, and we guarantee a spot for you during your week on any of the activities which are booked in advance through Inghams. For any excursions or activities booked with other providers (not through Inghams), we cannot guarantee that your Inghams activity schedule will not clash with these activities, and it may not be possible to reschedule any activities booked through Inghams.</p>]]></answer>
