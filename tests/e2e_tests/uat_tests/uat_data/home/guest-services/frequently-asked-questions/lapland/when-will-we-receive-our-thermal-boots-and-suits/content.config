  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Thermal suits and boots can be pre-booked in advance for the duration of your stay for guests aged 3 years and over. In resort, guests will be asked to collect their thermal suits and boots from our partner shop in the resort centre on arrival. For guests staying in the Ylläs Log Cabins, we usually make a stop on the way from the airport before dropping you off at your cabin, depending on how far your cabin is from the resort centre.</p>]]></answer>
