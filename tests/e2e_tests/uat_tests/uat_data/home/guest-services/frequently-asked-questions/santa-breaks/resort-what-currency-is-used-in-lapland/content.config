  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>The currency in Finland is the Euro. There are cash machines in Levi and Ylläs. If these are out of order however, there is nowhere else, so ensure you bring enough Euros with you! Major credit cards (except Amex) are accepted in hotels, most restaurants and for booking any of our excursions locally.</span></p>]]></answer>
