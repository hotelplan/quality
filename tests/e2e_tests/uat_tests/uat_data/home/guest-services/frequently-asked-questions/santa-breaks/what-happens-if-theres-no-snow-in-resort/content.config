If we have any cause for concern about the weather conditions, we will endeavour to contact you 7 days before your departure to let you know.<br /><br />If we and our suppliers believe that there’s not enough snow to run the activities included in your Santa Breaks package, we will contact you again 72 hours before travel with an update and advice on the options available to you, which may include cancellation.<br /><br /><strong>Our Snow Guarantee </strong>– In the event that we decide that there is insufficient snow you will have the following choices: you can amend your travel dates to any of our other Santa Breaks dates that are available in the same season and at no cost, provided that the elements of the holiday (accommodation, room type, duration and party composition) remain the same. If you change any of the holiday elements, you’ll need to pay the difference in price if it is more expensive, or if the new arrangements are cheaper, you will receive a refund of the difference. If you decide not to travel at all, you can cancel with a full refund of all monies paid to Santa Breaks for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Snow Guarantee is only valid on 3/4 night Santa Breaks.</p>]]></answer>
