  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Thermal suits and boots are included in our prices for all Inghams Santa Breaks holidays for guests aged 3yrs and over. In both Levi and Ylläs, guests will be asked to collect their thermal suits and boots from our partner shop in the resort centre on arrival. For guests staying in the Ylläs Log Cabins, we usually make a stop on the way from the airport before dropping you off at your cabin, depending on how far your cabin is from the resort centre.</p>
<p>We can cater for all sizes, but please mention if you need an extra-large thermal suit or boots when you book so we can advise our partner shop in advance to make sure they have a suit available for you on arrival.</p>
<p>For children under 0-2yrs, parents must bring their own thermal clothing as this is not included in the holiday price and availability locally cannot be guaranteed.</p>]]></answer>
