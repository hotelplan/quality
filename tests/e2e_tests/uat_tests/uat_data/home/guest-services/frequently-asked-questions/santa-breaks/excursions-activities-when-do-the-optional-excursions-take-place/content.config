  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Our Combined Husky &amp; Reindeer Safari and Snowmobiling Excursion operate at different times throughout the morning or afternoon. Usually, there are also additional activities available to book locally. Although we cannot advise your exact excursions days or times in advance, we guarantee that we will organise your itinerary to allow you to do all the activities you wish to do to make your holiday as memorable as possible. </p>

<p>Pre-booking your activities in the UK makes this easier for us and is also cheaper for you as activities booked locally are paid for in the local currency. Please call us on 01483 791 122 if you would like to add any activities to your booking.</p>]]></answer>
