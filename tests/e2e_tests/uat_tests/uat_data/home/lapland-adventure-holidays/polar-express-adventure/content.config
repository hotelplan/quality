<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 1 | ARRIVAL &amp; NORTHERN LIGHTS ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>Meet your Inghams Representative at Evenes Airport and transfer to your chosen hotel in Narvik. After settling in, join us for an <strong>orientation walk</strong> around Narvik to get to know your ‘home town’ from the outset. <br /><br />After dinner, we set off by coach on a guided tour into the wilderness, <strong>in search of the spectacular Northern Lights</strong>. Our experienced guide knows all the best spots, where minimal light pollution gives the best possible chance to see these amazing coloured lights, dancing in waves and ripples across the night sky.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 2 | ‘POLAR EXPRESS’ SCENIC TRAIN &amp; SWEDISH LAPLAND</h2>
<p>After breakfast, there’s a fantastic day-trip to the Swedish border, starting on the famous <strong>‘Polar Express’ train</strong>. From Narvik, this scenic train winds its way along the <strong>Ofotbanen Railway</strong>, through glistening snow-covered landscapes, between steep mountains and deep fjords to <strong>Riksgränsen</strong> in Swedish Lapland (approx. 50 minutes journey).</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052850/dx3m45.jpg" alt="Polar -express narrow" width="859" height="286" /><br /><br />At Riksgränsen we disembark to enjoy an array of <strong>snow activities</strong> such as a <strong>free 2 hour husky-sledding experience,</strong> plus <strong>snowmobiling, alpine skiing, a guided winter hike, or a tour of Riksgränsen</strong> (payable locally). An Arctic buffet lunch is included for a taste of this wonderful area, before boarding the train back to Narvik. This journey on Europe’s northernmost railway is regularly rated as one of the world’s most scenic rail-trips, so be sure to bring your camera!</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 3 | <strong>POLAR WILDLIFE PARK</strong></h2>
<p>After breakfast, a scenic coach journey brings us to the <strong>Polar Wildlife Park</strong>, the northernmost such park in the world, and home to many native species, including <strong>wolves, arctic foxes, lynx, wolverines, reindeer and moose</strong>. For a small local supplement (approx. £16), expert handlers will take you into the Arctic fox enclosure, to see these beautiful creatures up close. A buffet lunch in fantastic surroundings is included, before our return ‘home’ to Narvik.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 3-night breaks Sun-Weds) | RETURN TO UK</h2>
<p>Guests on our 3-night adventure have the morning at leisure, before the coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 4-night breaks Weds-Sun) | NARVIK &amp; SAMI EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>This morning we explore Narvik, steeped in military history and Norway’s major deep-water port. After a guided tour, we visit the famous <strong>Narvik Centre</strong> and the <strong>Red Cross War Museum</strong>, to learn about the famous 1940 <strong>Battle of Narvik</strong>, which involved Norwegian, French, Polish and British forces, including notably the Royal Navy. <br /><br />We also visit <strong>Narvik mountain</strong>, with its spectacular views of the town, go tobogganing if the spirit of adventure takes you, and a buffet lunch in a mountain restaurant is also included.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052804/sami-reindeer.jpg" alt="Sami -reindeer" width="859" height="347" rel="859,347" /><br /><br />To round off this final day, we take an evening trip to a traditional Sami camp and its traditional ‘Lavvu’ tent. Hosted by the Njalasouka family, enjoy a <strong>traditional Sami dinner</strong> around the open fire, meet the <strong>reindeer</strong> and try your hand at the art of lassoing! The evening provides another chance to see the spectacular Northern Lights, and we hope the perfect finale to your Northern Norway experience.</p>
