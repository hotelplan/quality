  <description><![CDATA[<p>Morzine is one of the most popular alpine towns in summertime, with visitors coming to enjoy the adventure sports, the mountain lifestyle and the general atmosphere in town, which offers cafés, bars, restaurants and shops. Morzine is a favourite for those that are keen on walking and biking, mountain biking is particularly popular and gives Morzine its world-famous summer status.</p>
<h3>Walking in Morzine</h3>
<p>For views of Mont Blanc and a horizon of jagged Alps, on a route not too taxing, take the circular walk from Mont Chery to Mont Caly. Or, follow the path of the French Resistance crossing into Switzerland over the Col de Cou, for something moderate in difficulty. Chairlifts boost walkers to higher ground and towards plenty of alpine restaurants, also giving access to charming neighbouring villages.</p>
<h3>Mountain bikers paradise</h3>
<p>Whether it’s road biking or mountain biking, gravel biking or e-biking, Morzine is the place for it - for first timers, experts and everyone in between. The Tour de France first came through Morzine in 1975, and it’s been a regular stage for the Tour since. Morzine Bike Park is open through summer with 650 kilometres of trails, 25 bike-friendly lifts and eight world-class bike parks - all on one lift pass (payable locally).</p>
<h3>Family Holidays in Morzine</h3>
<p>Your holiday includes a Morzine Multipass, which gives you access to various summer lifts (pedestrian access only) as well as discounts on local attractions - perfect for families looking to make the most of some of the local activities. Families that are keen on walking will find numerous routes in the area that cater to different abilities and vary in length. Smaller children will love the Fox Trail, with carved wooden foxes on the route for kids to spot along the way and when you've had enough, just turn back and head the way you came. For a great day out, visit the lovely Lac de Montriond, just a short bus ride from Morzine and great for paddling in the lake, enjoying a picnic in the sunshine or bigger kids may enjoy renting kayaks and paddleboards.</p>
<h3>A great destination for nature lovers</h3>
<p>There's nothing better than a summer holiday amongst nature and the scenery, lakes and mountains around Morzine are beautiful to explore. Make use of the summer lifts and head up into the mountains to enjoy some of the walking paths, bike trails or simple enjoy the views. The lakes around Morzine are also lovely to explore during the summer, with the popular Lac de Montriond nearby. Or, for quieter lakes, journey to Lac des Mines d’Or, that has a fantastic restaurant, or high altitude Lac de Joux Plane, that’s really remote.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Lac Montriond</h3>
<ul>
<li>3km loop</li>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Enjoy beautiful lake views</li>
</ul>
<p>The lake is accessible by public transport from Morzine and is the third largest natural lake in the Haute-Savoie region. The terrain is fairly flat around the lake so you can stroll or soak up the sun on the lake shore. If you're looking to extend your walk then you can head to the Ardent waterfall - its a bit of a climb but worth it.</p>
<h3>The Fox Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Up to 11km (one way)</li>
<li>A great walk for families</li>
</ul>
<p>The trail is a great way to explore the valley, its a gentle terrain that's 11 kilometres one way but you can turn around at any point if you want to shorten the walk. You'll walk next to the pretty Dranse river and along the way pass signs detailing facts about the local geology and habitats of the native foxes.</p>
<h3>La Boucle des Clarines (Les Gets)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>6km</li>
<li>Views of Mont Blanc in the distance</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll have to head to Les Gets for this route and use the Mont-Chery gondola but if you're after a glimpse of Mont Blanc then this is the walk for you. The walk isn't too challenging but there will be some ascents and descents.</p>
<h3>The Crest of Super Morzine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging walk</li>
<li>11km</li>
<li>Perfect for taking on some challenging climbs</li>
</ul>
<p>Head up to the Super Morzine area and embark on this 11km trail. You'll be hiking above Lake Montriond and walking amongst the mountains. If you're lucky you might spot a chamois, described as a goat-antelope and only residing in the mountains of Europe.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Fantastic cycling, mountain biking and sports activities</h3>
<p>The area of Morzine is known for its cycling with the Tour de France often passing through the town. Its mountainous surroundings make for some challenging climbs and exhilarating descents. Road cycling is very popular in this area and it's one of the Alps' leading destinations for mountain biking.</p>
<p>Morzine has a great range of sports events during summer. We've listed a few of our favourites below. Please be aware dates are subject to change and should be checked in advance, tickets might also be required and may need to be booked and paid for in advance:</p>
<p>The Passportes du Soleil - is usually held at the end of June and marks the beginning of some of the lifts opening and is a great event showcasing the bike trails in the area.</p>
<p>Tour de France Morzine - watch the worlds most famous road race, Morzine is known for its challenging mountain climbs so you can watch the racers be put to the test.</p>
<p>L'Etape Morzine - If you love the Tour de France then you might also love the L'Etape Morzine, its a chance for non-professional cyclists to experience the same section of course as the professionals, if you're not looking to sign up then spectating is just as much fun, the town has a great atmosphere at this time of year and it's exciting to be a part of the experience.</p>
<p>Mont Blanc Rallye - During this time of year you'll see an array of classic, sports and modern rally cars passing through the town, its an exciting event that's great for car-lovers.</p>
<h3>Try a new adventure</h3>
<p>If you are looking for an alpine adventure and want to try something different then look no further than Morzine. Go paragliding for panoramic views, plunge into deep pools while canyoning or try rock climbing and white water rafting. These activities are all supervised and led by qualified instructors.</p>
<h3>Seek out the rustic</h3>
<p>The picturesque village of Lindarets has plenty of restaurants to choose from, serving cheese, wine and traditional Savoyard cuisine. The village is also home to hundreds of wild goats that you'll see roaming the pathways and streets freely - just be sure to keep your distance.</p>

<p>Sunset at Brochaux waterfall is a magical experience, perfect also for a picnic lunch. You’ll likely have a goat or two for company that have wandered up from Lindarets.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p><span>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful. </span>Equipment is not available to hire in resort but there's plenty of places to buy high quality kit if you need anything.</p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p><span>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</span></p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Morzine</h3>
<p>We're sure you'll love walking in Morzine as much as we do, with an abundance of trails across the Portes du Soleil region there's a trail to suit everyone. In Morzine you'll find some lovely valley-level walks normally scattered with wildflowers and surrounded by dramatic peaks or take one of the summer lifts to get into the mountains. In the Alps you're never short of breath-taking scenery and if you're lucky you might even spot some local wildlife (just be sure to keep your distance). </p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of other guests. <span>Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</span></p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
