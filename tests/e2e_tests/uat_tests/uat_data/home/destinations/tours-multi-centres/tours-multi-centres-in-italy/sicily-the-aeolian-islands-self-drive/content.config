<h2><a name="Itinerary"></a><span class="geolocation-title">Itinerary</span></h2>
<p><strong>D</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 1: UK to Sicily</strong></p>
<p>Arrive at Catania Airport and head to collect your hire car. Drive south to Syracuse for your first night’s stay.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Syracuse</strong></p>
<p>Dedicate your first full day to getting to know Syracuse. There’s loads to see in this coastal town. The Archaeological Park’s in the north west – you’ll see incredible remains of the Greco Roman civilisations here, including one of the largest known Greek Amphitheatres. Head across the bridge to the island of Ortyga, the old town, which is packed with over 2,500 years of history. There’s lots of nice bars on the water front – perfect for aperitivo. But don’t fill up too much because we’ve booked dinner for you at one of Ortyga's top restaurants, so you can experience the delicious authentic food here.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner in Syracuse </p>
<p><strong>Day 3:</strong> <strong>Syracuse to Caltagirone</strong></p>
<p>Learn about <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/italy/sicily/south-east-sicily">South Eastern Sicily’s</a> Baroque past. In 1963 the region was struck by an earthquake that destroyed much of its infrastructure. Many of the buildings were re-built in the Baroque style. Spend the day driving between Noto, Modica and Ragusa Ibla comparing their baroque architecture on your way to the Caltagirone area for your overnight stay.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 4: Caltagirone area</strong></p>
<p>This morning drive on to Piazza Armerina. We’d recommend visiting Villa del Casale – it was owned and built by a powerful Roman family in the 4<sup>th</sup> Century AD. Today it’s known for having one of the richest collections of Roman mosaics in the world. Ceramic making traditions are deep rooted in Sicily’s culture and history, especially in Caltagirone. Just wandering through the town you’ll see the different styles and patterns of tiles and pottery – terracotta pots, glazed tiles of rich blues and yellows line the cobbled streets. Make sure you visit the beautiful Scalinata di Santa Maria del Monte - the town's ceramic-inlaid staircase</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: Caltagirone to Agrigento</strong></p>
<p>Get back on the road in the direction of Agrigento, to see the Valley of the Temples. The eight golden temples date back as far as 510 BC. They’re on a rocky ridge just outside Agrigento – so you can’t miss them. Spend the day learning about the ancient civilisations that built this city, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 6: Agrigento to Trapani</strong></p>
<p>Selinunte’s the largest archaeological sites in Europe. Come here to marvel at the ruins of the temples of one of the most eminent cities of Magna Graecia. The views from the hilltop are incredible too – you can see right out to sea. After spending the last few day’s soaking up so much of the islands history, we thought you might like a bit of a change, so we’ve planned some wine tasting at one of Sicily’s best vineyards. We’ve organised a home cooked lunch for you here too – you’ll need something to soak up the wine! Afterwards, make your way to Mozia – it’s on a mini archipelago off the west coast. There’s a beautiful nature reserve and and an Archeological site here. Finally take the salt road to Trapani. They produce salt here on vast planes, making for a pretty unique landscape to drive through,</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Wine tasting &amp; Lunch</p>
<p><strong>Day 7: Trapani Area</strong></p>
<p>The striking Medieval town of Erice rises up out of the surrounding landscape. Spend your morning wandering through the historic lanes, giving yourself time to pop into the famous Pasticceria Maria Grammatico for a sweet treat (payable locally). Drive on towards Marsala stopping off at a salt plant and museum – now you’ll have a bit of time to learn about it’s production in this region. You’ll have noticed all the olive groves as you’ve driven across the island – so we thought it would be nice for you to give the local olive oil a try. So this evening we’ve planned a tasting and dinner at one of Sicily’s, multi-award winning, olive oil producers. </p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Oil tasting &amp; Dinner</p>
<p><strong>Day 8:</strong> <strong>Trapani to Palermo</strong></p>
<p>Head towards Monreale. Drive through the groves of oranges and almond trees to reach the hilltop town of Monreale - it looks out over Palermo and the glittering Mediterranean beyond. Take a peek inside the UNESCO protected Norman cathedral – the ornate Byzantine mosaics are incredible. Take your time exploring and taking in the views over La Conca d'oro (The Golden Valley), before making your way on to the Palermo area.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 9:</strong> <strong>Palermo</strong></p>
<p>Spend the day in Sicily’s buzzing capital City, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/italy/city-breaks/palermo">Palermo</a>. Start off at one of the street markets – Ballarò’s a famous outdoor market here. Wander through, soaking up the kaleidoscope of colours and smells. Listen to the vendors enticing you in to by some fresh local produce – you’ll notice they often speak in the local Sicilian dialect. You’ll get a true feel for authentic Sicilian life here. As you explore, stop to notice the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Norman and later on mainland Italian influences that are reflected in the architecture. This evening, eat out in the historic centre – we’ve booked a table at a top restaurant for you.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner in Palermo</p>
<p><strong>Day 10: Palermo to Lipari</strong></p>
<p>Today you’ll leave the car behind and hop across to the Aeolian Islands. Drive to the port of Milazzo and park your hire car at a garage near the harbour, before jumping on a ferry that will take you to the beautiful Aeolian Island of Lipari where you will spend the night.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 11: Lipari Island</strong></p>
<p>Wake up to explore the largest island in the Archipelago, Lipari. Take a walking tour of the city or join an excursion to see the other islands, with their Volcanic black sandy beaches and dramatic rock formations. Head into Lipari for dinner out this evening.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner in Lipari </p>
<p><strong>Day 12: Lipari to Taormina</strong></p>
<p>Embark from Lipari to Malazzo port to collect your hire car and drive to your hotel in the <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/italy/sicily/taormina-area">Taormina</a> Area.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
<p><strong>Day 13: Taormina Area</strong></p>
<p>If you fancy a break from sight-seeing, spend the day relaxing by the hotel's lovely swimming pool. Alternatively, you can continue exploring. Start in Catania, the ancient port city – you’ll find contemporary art galleries and ancient Palazzos to visit. Meander your way back up to Taormina, perched above the undulating coast. Visit the ancient theatre while you’re here - In the summer months you may be lucky enough to catch a live performance in the Teatro Greco (payable locally). Corso Umberto is the bustling main street, which is lined with small shops, cafes and restaurants. Have your evening meal in a restaurant in the heart of the old town of Taormina tonight.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner in Taormina </p>
<p><strong>Day 14: Taormina / Mount Etna</strong></p>
<p>Mount Etna dominates Sicily’s east coast – you’re bound to have spotted the towering volcano as you’ve driven around the island. Today, see it up close. As you reach higher altitudes the scenery transforms into a lunar-like landscape of rich black lava. You can get close to the summit by taking the cable car or if you’re feeling energetic you can walk to the dormant craters. Once you’re at the top, on a clear day you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views. On your way back down towards the foot hills of the volcano stop at the farm of one of the vineyards on the flanks of the Etna, where you’ll have the chance to sample more of Sicily’s fantastic wine.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Wine tasting on Etna</p>
<p><strong>Day 15: Sicily to UK</strong></p>
<p>Make your way back Catania Airport to return your hire car and catch your flight home.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast</p>
