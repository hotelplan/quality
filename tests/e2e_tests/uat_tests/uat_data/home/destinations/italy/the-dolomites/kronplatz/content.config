  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kronplatz is the name of the mighty mountain that shares its name with the region beyond. Known as Plan de Corones in the local language of Ladin, there’s an array of ways to explore the valleys and peaks here, from footpaths to zip wires – as well as cable cars that put everything in easy reach. The village of San Vigilio di Marebbe welcomes visitors with mountain cuisine and cosy inns surrounded by pine woods, centuries-old farms and mountains. But, the wildest scenery lies just south, where Fanes-Senes-Braies Natural Park lays out the dramatic vistas the Dolomites are famous for – including the turquoise waters of Lago di Braies-Pragser Wildsee.</p>
<h2>Family holidays in Kronplatz </h2>
<p>Holidays to Kronplatz and surrounding towns have lots to offer for families in the summer. Whether you're looking for a mountain adventure like the 40-metre-long marble run at the top of the mountain station or family friendly walks like the bread and butter trail. You can not only enjoy those incredible mountain views but find an activity to suit all ages of the family! There's of course action packed fun too like the summer tubing track for those adrenaline junkies or the Kron trampoline park to see those mountain views from even higher. Hike alpine paths in the Dolomites, zoom down zip lines, tackle the via ferrata course, take to the skies on a paraglider, or rocket through the bike park on its dedicated (and occasionally hair-raising) trails - you are simply spoilt for choice in Kronplatz for family fun! </p>
<h2>Mountain huts and mountain museums</h2>
<p>Hiking paths lead into the rocky vistas of the Dolomites – or you can stick to a leisurely loop around Kronplatz, stopping at the mountain huts, viewpoints and museums en route. Messner Mountain Museum, Corones is the Space Age creation of architect Zaha Hadid and renowned local mountaineer Reinhold Messner. Duck inside the plateau-edge museum to learn all about the history of mountaineering in the Tyrol. Rifugio restaurants serve up mountain fare nearby, with energy-boosting menus of canederli bread dumplings and charcuterie boards piled high with smoked speck ham and herb-crusted cheese.</p>
<h2>Welcome to Ladinia</h2>
<p>It’s a good idea to learn a little of the three local languages if planning a holiday to Kronplatz. German is most widely spoken after the region’s stint under Austrian rule, but you’ll also hear Italian and Ladin, the original language of these once-remote mountain valleys. In fact, Kronplatz is a stronghold of Ladin culture – best experienced by staying in a valley village such as San Vigilio di Marebbe. Here, life revolves around the cobblestone village square, where a baroque church points its steeple to the sky. Chalet-like houses, hotels and restaurants line the streets, some adorned with wood carvings and serving Tyrolean favourites like crispy feies da soni potatoes and poppy seed pasta.</p>
<h2>Into the wild: walking in the Fanes-Sennes-Braies and Puez Odle natural parks</h2>
<p>There’s a wild world beyond Kronplatz. Fanes-Senes-Braies Natural Park stretches out to the south-east. It’s perhaps best-known for the Alta Via 1 – one of the most famous long-distance hikes in the Dolomites. Easier routes take you rambling past sheer mountain faces, and onwards through bright green pastures grazed by hardy cows, rocky, forested valleys, and mountain meadows awash with wildflowers. The walking opportunities here are endless! </p>
<p>The neighbouring Puez Odle Natural Park is another great choice for wanderers who like their walks with a bit of drama. The unusual geology of the Dolomites is on full display here, including tunnel-like cleft mountains and towering limestone karsts. Keep your eyes on the skies – you might just spy a golden eagle gliding overhead.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cable Cars</strong></p>
<p>In true mountain fashion, the cable cars around San Vigilio di Marebbe are the best way to get up to those sought after viewpoints. The first lifts open in mid-May, but all lifts will be open by late June, so you’ll have more choice available. Many of the lift opening times and names are listed on the <a href="https://www.kronplatz.com/en/the-kronplatz/tickets-prices/operating-time">Kronplatz official website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the walking areas slightly further afield, the Kronplatz 2000 lift in Brunico is open from mid-May and takes about 15 minutes to the top (2,275 metres) from the valley and has fantastic views of the main town of Brunico. You can access this lift by taking a couple of public buses, your Inghams rep will be on hand to help you find your way there.</p>
<p>Other cable cars in the area include the Piz de Plaies cable car which opens from the end of June and the Ruis cable car which is open every day from mid-June.</p>
<p><strong>Buses</strong></p>
<p>The buses are a useful and affordable way of hopping from place to place in the Alta Badia region. If you use your free guest card, local buses are free (not applicable to the private Cortina Express bus), so they're a great option. To get to the main bus and train station you’ll have to head to the main town of Brunico, which you can get to on the bus. The bus from San Vigilio to Brunico has one change; take the 461 bus from San Vigilio to Zwischenwasser and change to the 460 bus to Brunico. This journey takes around 40 minutes in the daytime.</p>]]></gettingAround>

<p>Starting from the church in Lungiarü, passing over bridges and through forests to the town of Frëina. You’ll head through farms and the hamlet of Seres as you head towards the Val di Murins (Valley of the Mills). A really fertile piece of land, you’ll be surrounded by grass and trees with a stream rushing by. Pass the stream and you’ll head on towards the hamlet of Miscì, from which you’ll head downhill towards a very picturesque larch wood forest, with a small chapel and a nearby limestone kiln. Head back to Lungiarü along a wooded path.</p>
<ul>

If you love church architecture, this is a great route to look into. The church of St.Valentin has a wonderful gothic style. From here you’ll head to church number two in Falzes, the church of St.Cyriak, where you can see the fantastic high altarpiece, by Karl von Henrici. The third church, St.Nicolas in Issengo, has a combination of Baroque and Gothic architectural features. The last church on this route, the church of Hasenreid, is dedicated to St. John the Baptist and is another example of late Gothic style architecture and was once a popular pilgrimage site. From here you’ll continue onto the Pfaffensteig trail and back to Grimaldo where the walk began.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Kronplatz - a summer activity hub and stronghold of Ladin mountain culture, with the wilderness right on its doorstep and plenty of walking routes to explore]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p>Plan de Corones sits below Mount Kronplatz. The unique flat top mountain is perfect for a family day out exploring the area. Keep an eye out for wildlife on the way up in the gondola. At the top there’s a farm where the Tibetan highland yaks are always posing for a photo.</p>
<p>A visit to the Messner Mountain Museum is a must. In this space-like building carved into the rock side you can learn all about Reinhold Messner, the extreme climber and mountaineer. Exhibits include the science of glaciers and the history of the local people. </p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>The region’s famous for its food with influences from Italy, Austria and Switzerland. Be sure to try delicious local food like canederli (bread dumplings) with local speck ham and cheese. Alpine huts dotted around the mountains are some of the best places to immerse yourself in the local food scene. They’re also the perfect spot for a cool beer or refreshing glass of wine. </p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Mountain biking is massive in the area with loads of trails ready to be torn up. All levels are welcome with a range of routes to try. Enjoy the lovely sweeping flow-lines running down the mountain on your own or speak to the bike school in resort for expert advice. </p>
<p>Kronplatz is full of action. Have a go at archery, take to the high ropes course or hurl yourself down a zip wire - it’s all possible here.</p>
<p>The latest attraction found at the top of Mount Kronplatz is the Skyscraper. Strap into your harness and let gravity do the rest on this giant swing. Will you be brave enough to keep your eyes open and embrace the incredible views?</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p><strong>Hiking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help them stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:</li>
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<p><strong>Why we love walking around Kronplatz</strong></p>
<p>Kronplatz and the town of San Vigilio di Marebbe is a great Dolomite location if you’re looking for a mountain holiday with some easier walking trails. It has a good mixture of flatter and more mountainous terrain. There are lots of hilly areas surrounding the valley as well as meadowland, so it doesn’t have to be strenuous, and families will be well catered for. From lakes in the Fanes-Senes-Pargs Nature Reserve to mountain museums, there’s a great combination of sights to explore.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
