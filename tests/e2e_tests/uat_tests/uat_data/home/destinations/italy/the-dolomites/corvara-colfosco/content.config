  <description><![CDATA[<p>From swimming in the pure waters of Biotope lake, to discovering the WWI trenches and open-air museum at Cinque Torri, to making a long Italian lunch the activity of the day - Corvara and Colfosco have summer covered. Both villages sit in the Alta Badia region, known for its fine food and wine, an active lifestyle, and mountains so uniquely beautiful they’re UNESCO protected.</p>
<h3>National parks, geological sites, mountain lakes</h3>
<p>There are two nature parks around Corvara and Colfosco, the Puez-Geisler (or Puez Odle) and Fanes-Senes-Braies. Together they provide mile-upon-mile of pathways to explore - far more than can be covered in a single holiday - with stunning views, colourful wild flowers and various geological sites well worth a visit. For a day out, hop on the local bus and head up the road to La Villa to potter about the pretty village and grab a bite to eat next to Sompunt Lake. On your way back to Corvara, visit the 16th century Colz Castle in a picture-perfect location.</p>
<h3>Eating your way through the Dolomites: a taste of the Italian Tyrol</h3>
<p>You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to eating out here; Alta Badia is one of the best regions in the Dolomites for gastronomy, whether it’s a casual pizza you’re after or a Michelin-starred meal. The key is fresh, local ingredients, from speck (cured ham) to cheese and dairy products. A mountain hut is the place to head for a low-key, traditional lunch, and they tend to have the best views of the surrounding mountains.</p>
<h3>Family walking through a UNESCO heritage site</h3>
<p>The Dolomite mountains are no doubt the main attraction of Corvara and Colfosco, and walking through the landscape is why most come to the region. There are so many trails to choose from; The Cascate del Pisciadu walk is roughly 8km, starting in Corvara and ending at a beautiful waterfall. For another non-technical route, take the Boe gondola from Corvara then jump on the Vallon chairlift and before you know it you’ll be enjoying 360 degree views and gentle walking trails in the sunshine. The gondola system in the area is fantastic if you're exploring with children. It means you can experience the incredible views without putting too much strain on little legs!</p>
<h3>Whether it’s on an electric, mountain or road bike, you'll be in good company around Corvara</h3>
<p>The whole area is crazy about biking - with over 350 routes to choose from. Hire a bike and head out, whether it's cruising along a gentle cycle path in the valley with children, or jumping on a lift to enjoy the thrill of downhill mountain biking (teens will love it!). Keen road bikers should grab an e-bike (yes, you’ll need the battery boost) and ride around the famous Sella Ronda. Though it’s not particularly long - around 65 kilometres - there’s a huge amount of up-and-down (almost 2,000 metres in altitude); it’s a bucket list cycle for good reason!</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<p>Corvara and Colfosco are great for families who just love being outdoors! If you’re looking for activities for all ages this is a great area to visit; teenagers can try out more adventurous activities such as para-gliding while the little ones have fun in one of the local play areas and nature parks.</p>
<h3>Family activities</h3>
<p>In Corvara and Colfosco there are lots of fun activities to try out including ice-skating, climbing, tennis and archery. They have big play areas with paddling pools and deck chairs. For teenagers, why not try a more thrill-seeking activity such as tandem paragliding over the mountainous terrain; there's no better way to take in the views!</p>
<p>Adventure Park Colfosco's a great place to head for a family day out. It's high ropes courses of various levels are immersed in wooded nature and will keep children entertained for hours. If climbing indoors is more your speed then head to Corvara's boulder centre, an indoor rock climbing centre.</p>
<h3>Fantastic for biking</h3>
<p>This area is also really well set up for biking with over 350 routes to choose from, so there’s plenty of choice if you want an easier child friendly route or a challenging ‘thrill- seeking teenager’ route. If you just want to stick to going down the mountains, then it's easy to jump on a lift and enjoy the descent back down, clocking up the miles as you go.</p>
<h3>Family nature walks</h3>
<p>If your family love nature, then the Movimënt dles ês programme in Corvara is not to be missed. It's a nature project which teaches all age groups about the importance of bees within our eco-system, through interactive experiences and fun signposting, as you walk through a nature park. These projects are fantastic opportunities to get children engaged with nature and the importance of preserving it for generations to come.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Cable Cars</h3>
<p>All of our hotels are within walking distance to a nearby cable car, all but one within a five minute walk away, making it easy to head up into the mountains and start walking straight away. In the summer, lifts open from mid-June until early October. The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.altabadia.org/en/summer-holidays/lifts/summer-opening.html" target="_blank">Alta Badia official website</a> has the most up to date information about the opening times of the main lifts in the area.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>The buses are a useful and affordable way of hopping from place to place in the Alta Badia. If you use your free guest card, local buses are free (not applicable to the private Cortina Express bus), so they're a great option. To get from Corvara to Colfosco, all you have to do is take the no. 460 bus which takes under 10 minutes, or if you’re a foodie then head slightly further to the resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/edb6d2efa6f64ef5bd925f12684524d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/edb6d2efa6f64ef5bd925f12684524d1}" title="San Cassiano">San Cassiano</a> on the 465 bus which takes around 25 minutes.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Cascate del Pisciadu</h3>
<p>Walking from Corvara to Colfosco through grassy meadows, which are lovely underfoot and through shaded woodlands. You’ll cross bridges over streams and listen to the gentle trickling of the water as you head to the bottom of the dominating Sella Massif, the Dolomite mountain range that towers above you, in contrast to the gentle meadows and streams you’ll pass on the way! This is where you’ll find the Pisciadú waterfall which rushes down over the mountain rocks. This is a gentle walk, ideal for families, or just a relaxed moment to enjoy the nature surrounding you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3.7km (walking time approx. 1 hour 10 minutes)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 204 metres (ascent) 14 metres (descent)</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> asphalt surfaces, woodland, meadows</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sass da Ciampac Circumnavigation</h3>
<p>See the Dolomites from a totally different perspective on this circular walk. Not as the lush green coated mountain range that you see in pictures but from the top you’ll experience the striking, rocky side of this mountain range; almost as if you’ve hopped on a space shuttle and landed on the moon! This is a great walk if you want to experience the ‘Dolomite Giants’, the Sella Group, the Mittag Valley, Puez Group, Sassongher, Sasso Croce Group, Lavarella, Conturines, Lagazuoi and Val Gardena and Val Badia. See how the landscape changes as you head from the grassy meadows of Corvara and the Gardena Pass and up to the Sass da Ciampac, down into the picturesque Edelweiss Valley.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 13km (walking time approx. 5 hours 30 mins)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 950 metres</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, forested paths, curated paths, roads</li>
<li><strong>Getting there:</strong> Taking a taxi to the starting point of the walk at the Passo Gardena takes approx. 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lake Crespeina</h3>
<p>Walk all the way up to the Crespeina Plateau at 2,370 metres to visit the Crespeina lake which puddles between Val Gardena and Val Badia. The lake has a legendary past and in Ladin folklore is believed to have been the place where a dragon unleashed his wrath on the lake and surrounding area. You’ll also come across another lake during this walk, Lake Ciampaise. On a good day, the lake will be full of crystal clear mountain water, but it does have periods where it dries out – so it’ll be a matter of luck!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9km (walking time approx. 4 hours)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 450 metres (ascent) 930 metres (decent)</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, forested paths, natural paths, curated paths, asphalt surfaces</li>
<li><strong>Getting there:</strong> Taking a taxi to the starting point of the walk at the Passo Gardena Car Park takes approx. 15 minutes</li>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Outdoor adventure in the mountains with Italian style and charm, it’s the best of both worlds in Corvara & Colfosco]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p>There's two nature parks here, both part of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Puez-Geisler and Fanes-Senes-Braies parks provide miles of exploring with great views, wild flowers and geological places of interest. </p>
<p>Have a day out and head to La Villa, just up the road. Potter round the pretty village and grab a bite to eat and a drink next to Sompunt Lake. On your way back to resort, visit the 16th century Colz Castle. This impressive building has a rich history and makes for a great photo with the Dolomites in the background.  </p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink </h3>
<p>You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to eating out here. Alta Badia is one of the best regions in the Dolomites for gastronomy and whether you fancy a casual pizza or a Michelin-starred meal, you’ll find it here. Local food is the star of the show in most restaurants so try speck (cured meats) and the local meats and dairy products. We love grabbing lunch in a mountain hut – they have the best views. If you’re celebrating a special occasion then book a table at  La Stüa de Michil in Hotel La Perla – it’s been awarded a Michelin star for its food.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Walking is one of the main attractions here – there’s so many trails to choose from thanks to the two national parks. We recommend the Cascate del Pisciadu walk. It's about eight kilometres starting in Corvara and out towards the woods before ending at a beautiful waterfall. Other activities in the area range from a game of tennis to a round of golf.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Corvara &amp; Colfosco</h3>
<p>When you’re up in the Dolomite mountains, everywhere you look is absolutely incredible – from walking at sunrise or sunset and catching the famous 'enrosadira', when the sun hits the peaks in such away that they emanate a pinky-orange glow, to stopping off for a typical Tyrolean lunch in a rustic mountain hut. Whether you’re new to walking, and just love strolling through the sublime mountain setting, taking in the gravity of nature, or you’re an expert hiker looking to scale challenging peaks and push yourself to the limit in pursuit of a rare viewpoint, Corvara &amp; Colfosco have got you covered. It’s this variety of landscapes, trails and rich food that makes us come back to this area again and again.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
