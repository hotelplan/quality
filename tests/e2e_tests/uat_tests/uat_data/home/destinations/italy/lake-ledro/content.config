  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lake Ledro is a scene straight out of a fairy tale, with emerald waters that mirror the mountains and pine forests all around. Walking trails circle the lake and zig-zag down to Riva – the northernmost town of Lake Garda. There are around 200km worth of trails around these parts, so it’s a case of pick a path, any path. Just make sure to stop at the alpine cheese huts and panoramic viewpoints along the way.</p>
<h2>Ledro's looking-glass lake</h2>
<p>Relaxation is the theme in Lake Ledro. An easy-going 9km loop of the lake takes in the pebble beaches and picnic spots that dot the water’s edge. Paddlers can hire a paddle board or kayak and glide across the mirror-like water, which can reach a balmy 24˚C in summer – so no worries if you end up spending more time in the water than out. Windsurfing, sailing and pedalos are also popular pursuits.</p>
<h2>Walking along fairytale pathways</h2>
<p>The old Ponale Road leads between Lake Ledro and Riva, on the northern shore of Lake Garda. This panoramic path shadows the lake line, meandering downhill through woodland trails, valleys and cobbled mule paths – all reserved for walkers and cyclists. Head north-west instead, and you’ll come to the cascading Gorg d’Abiss waterfall, where some seriously enchanting scenery is tucked away. The Ledro Land Art trail is on the south side of the lake, where you can take a treasure-hunt looking for around twenty sculptures amongst the trees.</p>
<h2>Unravelling 4,000 years’ of history at Molina de Ledro</h2>
<p>Palafitte stilt houses decorate the eastern end of Lake Ledro. Dating back to 2200-1350 BC, these pre-historic thatched dwellings were rediscovered in 1929, when the lake’s water levels were lowered to fuel the hydro-electric plant at Riva. The Museum of Pile Dwellings reveals the origins and the daily lives of the Bronze Age residents who lived in these lovingly restored buildings.</p>
<h2>Food, glorious food: eating in Lake Ledro</h2>
<p>Alpine cuisine is the speciality of Lake Ledro, where family-run farms produce Trentino specialities with a whole lot of love and several generations’ worth of knowledge. Try creamy alpine cheeses at a local dairy or pull up a chair on the terrace of a mountain hut for a feast of caponec (sausage, herbs and cheese packed into vine leaves) and strangolapreti (spinach and Parmesan dumplings). Fancy a celebratory holiday fizz? The Ledro favourite is a picco spritz of strawberry and raspberry liqueur from the Ledro Valley, prosecco and tonic water. Cin cin!</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Lake Ledro with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Lake Ledro's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</span></p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Make good use of the Trentino Guest Card</h3>
<p>When staying at a selection of our hotels in Lake Ledro you'll get a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.visittrentino.info/en/experience/trentino-guest-card" target="_blank">Trentino Guest Card</a> which entitles you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free use of all public trains and buses in the Trentino region</li>
<li>Discounted entry to over 60 museums, 20 castles &amp; 40 attractions in Trentino</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The guest card only applies to affiliated hotels</em></p>
<h3>Things to see and do in Lake Ledro</h3>
<p>The Pile dwelling museum in Molina's definitely worth a visit. It'll give you an insight into the way people lived on Lake Ledro 4000 years ago. It's a bronze age settlement and a UNESCO heritage site. For more history, the Garibaldi Museum's great for the first world war history of the area. Did you know Ledro was on the front line in World War 1? If you love nature, take a day trip to Lake Ampola on the bus, the journey will take you about an hour, otherwise hire a taxi and you can get there in about ten minutes. The lake has been kept in its completely natural state and the nature reserve's full of animals. In the Summer there are endless types of insects, birds and mammals. Our favourite thing about Ampola is the water lilies that bloom in the Spring and turn the whole pond yellow.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love cheese? The cheese in the Lake Ledro area is fantastic. You can visit the Alpine dairy farms and see cheese being made from scratch. The Ledro Valley's full of regional dishes, one of which, is Caponec, a sausage, herb and cheese mixture wrapped in vine leaves. There's also the hearty strangolapreti, green dumplings from Trentino, flavoured with spinach and parmesan.</p>
<p>When it's time for a drink, the Picco spritz is definitely one to try on a sunny day. It's a cocktail made with Picco Rosso, a strawberry and raspberry liqueur from the Ledro Valley and garnished with strawberries- delicious!</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Ledro's a fantastic spot for water sports. It's clear, fresh water is great for swimming, sailing, canoeing and windsurfing. You can even try your hand at fishing which is a great way to relax, and take in the incredible scenery around you. Another way to enjoy the area is by checking out one of the many walking and bike trails in the valley. There's at least 200km worth of trails around. The Gorg d'Abiss waterfall in Tiarno di Sotto's hidden away in the valley. You have to walk along a narrow path along the Massangla stream to get there, but it's worth it in the end! Alternatively, if you love art, try out the Ledro Land Art trail in the Pur forest. Follow the trail and see how many sculptures you can spot.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingDescription><![CDATA[<p>Lake Ledro and its surroundings offer a wide choice of walks and hiking trails, with many start points easily reached by public transport (free with the Trentino Guest Card). For an ideal introduction to you resort, walk the 9km perimeter of Lake Ledro, taking in the restored bronze age palafitte houses (on stilts) at the southern end of the lake. The old Ponale Road to Riva is a famous, breathtakingly panoramic downhill walk, and not to be missed.</p>
<p>POPULAR WALKS include:</p>
<p><strong>Val Concei</strong> / 3 hrs / Easy</p>
<p>Walk through the peaceful, remarkably unspoilt beech and pine forest of the Val Concei, keeping an eye out for wild game. Stop at the lovely chalet style Rifugio Al Faggio and refuel with a typical dish of the region before returning. Suitable for all abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Gorg d’Abiss waterfall</strong> / 3 hrs / Easy</p>
<p>The ancient roman roads via Tiarno will bring you to the lovely Gorg d’Abiss gorge and waterfall, which over the years has carved a deep canyon through the rocks. Take in the Mulino dei Bugatini watermill en route.</p>
<p><strong>Panoramas of Cime Pari</strong> / 6 hrs / Slightly Challenging</p>
<p>For more experienced hikers. From Lenzumo take the cow track to Bocca Saval then follow the First World War trenches to Cima Pari, an ideal spot for lunch as you take in views across Ledro, Lake Garda and the Dolomites beyond. On the descent join the Path of Peace until Rifugio Pernici, for a refreshment.</p>
<p>TOURIST OFFICE GUIDED WALKS</p>
<p>The local Tourist Office runs an excellent programme (FREE with the Trentino Guestcard) of guided walks, including two half day walks suitable for all levels including families, plus a full day walk requiring a minimum level of fitness, each week. Walks start from various points within the valley. Participation needs to be registered with the Tourist Office in Pieve.</p>
<p><strong>Ponale Way to Riva</strong> / Approx 4 hrs / Easy</p>
<p>The old Ponale track from the southern end of Ledro to Riva del Garda is one of Italy’s most dramatic panoramic walks. Cut through the cliffs above Lake Garda, the views all along this most characteristic descent to Riva are superb. Return from Riva via public bus.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Botanical Walk to Dromae</strong> / Approx 6 hrs / Moderate</p>
<p>From Mezzolago follow the botanical path towards the gardens of Dromae, taking in First World War Austrian front line trenches en route. Completing the ascent to Dromae’s perfumed meadows of white narcissus and wild peonies, absorb the stunning views over Lake Ledro.</p>]]></walkingDescription>
  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<p><strong>Why we love walking in Lake Ledro</strong></p>
<p>From flat lakeside promenades to steep mountain climbs, the walking area around Lake Ledro has something for everyone. You can explore trails along the shores of Lake Garda, venture into the mountains, or walk through lush valleys and charming villages. Our favourite trail, The Ponale Way, links Lake Ledro to <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> in <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, it takes you along cliff paths, with lake views and through the occasional tunnel built into the cliffside. It’s one of the most popular routes in the area and means you can head to Lake Garda for the day and get to know a new part of the Trentino region.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
