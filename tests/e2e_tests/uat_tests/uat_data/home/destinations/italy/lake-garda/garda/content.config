  <description><![CDATA[<p>The eponymous town of Garda is a sought-after summer holiday spot whether for families, friends, couples or solo travellers – but that’s nothing new. People have flocked to <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> for millennia, each leaving their storied stamp; from Bronze Age rock art and Roman vineyards to Venetian villas and historic hotels. Summer holidays in Garda are all about whiling away time walking around the old town and along the promenade. But there’s still more to see beyond this sheltered bay. The rest of Lake Garda calls – as well as the cities of <a data-udi="umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7}" title="Venice">Venice</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona,</a> just a ferry and train ride away.</p>
<h3>Family walking around Garda</h3>
<p>Summer walking holidays in Garda embrace laid-back lakeside living. Drift along the promenade, stopping at one of the many bars for an Aperol spritz or for the young ones, a generous scoop of stracciatella gelato. We love wandering around Garda's historic town centre, with its Gothic-Venetian church and villas. Make sure to drop by the Friday market to browse stalls piled high with bottles of Bardolino wine and marbled mountain cheeses from the nearby <a data-udi="umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496}" title="The Dolomites">Dolomites</a>. Children will love trying the tasters in the different stalls- see how many types of cheese you can get your hands on; in true Italian style, the food and drink is delicious and fresh!</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in Lake Garda: must see summer holiday sights</h3>
<p>Garda's tree-lined promenade stretches south to <a data-udi="umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1}" title="Bardolino">Bardolino</a> and further still to Lazise – a beautiful lakeside walk or cycle; children will love pedalling way along the lakeside. Follow it north, and and you'll find yourself in Punta San Vigilio. This scenic headland is topped with cypress trees, an historic 16<sup>th</sup>-century villa and a trattoria with tables laid out, just a pebble’s throw from the water. Mermaid Bay is just around the corner – it's one of the best summer beaches and sunset watching spots on Lake Garda, and well worth forking out a few euros for the entry fee. It's a wonderful spot for a family beach day! If you fancy giving the calf muscles a workout, make sure you climb the 6km up to La Rocca for panoramic views, it's a beautiful walk. Look out over the pin-striped vineyards and sailing boats that characterise the eastern shore of Lake Garda.  </p>
<h3>Exploring Lake Garda by boat, bus and cable car</h3>
<p>Buses and ferries pootle between the towns of Lake Garda all summer long. Torri del Benaco is a 10-minute ride away. Here, a museum castle that once belonged to the ruling Scaliger family exhibits local curiosities like antique olive presses and Bronze Age carvings found in Garda’s hills. Alternatively, head for the ferry port. It’s a short hop across the water to <a data-udi="umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11}" title="Gardone Riviera">Gardone</a>'s Heller Botanical Gardens or the castle-crowned <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione.</a> The further north you venture, the more mountain views there are to enjoy. Jump off in <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a> to peruse the pretty terracotta-tiled town before hopping on the cable car up Monte Baldo. Monte Baldo is full of fantastic walking trails, where you'll find some of the best views of Lake Garda. There's a good range of trails so it's not hard to find a path that children will love just as much as adults.</p>
<h3>V for Venice (and vineyards)</h3>
<p>Olive groves and vineyards fill the hills behind Garda – an excellent chance to sample Bardolino's famous red wine. For a mini adventure, catch the boat to Peschiera on Lake Garda’s southern edge, where the train station offers direct services to Verona (just 20 minutes away) and Venice (a scenic 1 hour 15 minutes).</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Bardolino to Cisano</h3>
<p>A pleasant walk along the lakefront that leads from Bardolino to Cisano, a district of Bardolino. This is a really unique part of the lake due to its stretches of coastline freckled with reeds. Check out the lake‘s rich bird life and deep dive into the typical fish and avifauna at Museo Sisàn.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy<br /><strong>Distance:</strong> 8km<br /><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 3.5 hours<br /><strong>Ascent/descent:</strong> 5m<br /><strong>Terrain:</strong> mostly paved with short dirt sections, flat<br /><strong>Useful Information:</strong> There is a local bus which takes around 8 minutes between Garda and Bardolino (approx. €2 one way, payable locally).</p>
<h3>The Ridges of Monte Baldo</h3>
<p>This walk heads up to the ridges of Monte Baldo where the views across Lake Garda are breath-taking. Starting in Malcesine (accessible by ferry or bus from Garda) hop on the Monte Baldo cable car (payable locally) which will take you up Monte Baldo. Taking the cable car means you won't have long to wait before getting your first glimpse of Lake Garda and the surrounding mountains from the top!</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> Challenging<br /><strong>Distance:</strong> 10km<br /><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 5 hours<br /><strong>Ascent/descent:</strong> 500m<br /><strong>Terrain:</strong> some dirt trails, sections of rocky and uneven terrain, steep ascents</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Garda makes a big impression; thanks to its coveted spot on the eastern shore of Lake Garda, it's the perfect location for a summer walking holiday with the family]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Summer fun: nearby attractions</h3>
<p>Garda’s got good ferry links to the rest of the lake so it's great for exploring Lake Garda in the summer. <a data-udi="umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11}" title="Gardone Riviera">Gardone</a> is just across the lake and is where you’ll find the Heller Botanical Gardens – great for anyone with an interest in nature and art. You can also hop on a ferry to <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione</a> and wander round the castle and historic centre.</p>
<h3>Walking and activities around Garda</h3>
<p>Garda's fairly flat so if you’re looking to get your steps up with some relaxing lakeside walks, it’s ideal. You can walk along the promenade to nearby Bardolino quite easily. Walk to a Bardolino vineyard for a wine tasting or stop off in a lakeside restaurant for some Italian food. If you want a bit more of a challenge, take a walk along the six-kilometre route up La Rocca. When you get to the top you’ll get to enjoy panoramic views over the lake. Garda’s promenade is traffic free so it’s perfect for leisurely bike rides in the sun. It’s a lovely way to travel around Lake Garda and visit nearby towns.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a paper map to help you get to know the area even better, we'd recommend the Kompass 697 - Lake Garda (1:35,000).</p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The lakes and mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Garda</h3>
<p>Walking around Garda is calm and relaxed, there are lots of flatter, lakeside walks to enjoy if you're looking for something less strenuous on your summer holiday. Head out a little further, to Monte Baldo, and you'll be greeted with a vast area of walking for all abilities. The views from up here are out of this world!</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities for exploring around Garda; check out the Bronze Age rock carvings on Monte Luppia or walk to the Sisan museum and jump head first into learning about the lake's bird life and water life.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>

The walk along to San Vigilio along the lakefront is also very pretty and a lovely place to stop off for a glass of Italian <em>vino</em>. '</p>",
