  <facilityDescription><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Restaurant and Bar</span></strong></p>
<p>Being bed and breakfast, there is no restaurant onsite at Hotel Internazionale however there is a quaint breakfast room where a continental buffet of hot and cold foods is served each morning. With freshly baked breads, cakes, pastries along with cold cuts, local cheeses, pancakes, bacon and eggs cooked to order there is plenty to get you started for your day. The bar in the hotel is open for an a la carte lunch service which can be booked and paid for locally where you can dine out on the terrace overlooking the lake from a menu of stone baked pizzas, paninis and pasta. The bar is open late into the evening and is the perfect spot for a nightcap when you've returned from dinner at one of the many restaurants located in the centre of Malcesine just 10 minutes away on foot. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pool and Beaches</span></strong></p>
<p>Nestled amongst the olive trees in the garden, the large pool at Hotel Internazionale overlooks the glittering waters of Lake Garda and the majestic mountains beyond. There are plenty of parasols and sun loungers scattered around the pool, providing an ideal sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the nearby town. For those wanting to take a dip in the azure waters of Lake Garda itself, you can visit one of the many man made beaches along the shoreline towards town including the famous beach of Navene which is just a 10 minute bus ride away from the town centre. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spa</span></strong></p>
<p>In the main building you'll find a cozy wellness centre which includes a fitness room, sauna and Jacuzzi where you can kick back and relax after a day exploring the cobbled streets of Malcesine or simply escape the sunshine for a few hours and enjoy complimentary water and herbal teas. *Please note that the sauna and solarium must be paid for locally</p>]]></facilityDescription>
