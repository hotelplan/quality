On arrival you'll have some free time for lunch and a chance to discover the nooks and crannies of this wonderful city. Explore the marble paved shopping street of Via Mazzini which leads to the pretty market square Piazza Delle Erbe. You can then join a walking tour of the city where you'll see the impressive 2,000-year-old Roman arena (entry not included).

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lake Garda is packed with things to see and do. It’s Italy’s largest lake and has some of the country’s most beautiful scenery. Expect snow-capped mountains in the north and rolling countryside in the south. You can just as easily spend your days exploring walking and cycling trails as you can chilling next to the lake. The south of the lake has some of the most popular resorts and lots of opportunities to do wine tasting and city sightseeing, while the north is more geared up for active holidays with walking, cycling and water sports. We love combining both on a <a data-udi="umb://document/75608f96f365422d89a1d50cd6c3339e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/75608f96f365422d89a1d50cd6c3339e}" title="Multi-Centre Holidays">multi-centre holiday</a>.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of <a data-udi="umb://document/6c247f7108ac4a65a8e24e3b8ccd90a9" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6c247f7108ac4a65a8e24e3b8ccd90a9}" title="Things to Do in Lake Garda">things to do on Lake Garda</a>. We fill our days here with ferry trips along the lake, hopping on and off to explore the towns. It's easy to do and the views from the water are great. Don't miss the castle in <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a>, it's at the top of the town so you'll get some pretty nice views from there. <a data-udi="umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c}" title="Limone">Limone</a> is the lake's prettiest town so stop here for a coffee in the piazza. <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione</a> has lots of history to explore and there's a fun weekly market in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/italy/lake-garda/garda">Garda</a>. Gardaland is close by so get some thrills and ride the rollercoaster. You can go further afield too - <a data-udi="umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7}" title="Venice">Venice</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona</a> and the <a data-udi="umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496}" title="The Dolomites">Dolomites</a> are all easy day trips.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>Wine is pretty big business in Lake Garda. There’s two festivals dedicated to it every year in <a data-udi="umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1}" title="Bardolino">Bardolino</a> and this is the best resort to stay in if you want to visit vineyards to do some tastings. There’s nothing quite like lingering over a lakeside lunch with a glass of local wine. There’s plenty of restaurants to choose from too. Fish features on the menu a lot and it’s often freshly caught from the lake. You’ll also find local olive oil and citrus fruits used in almost all restaurants. Chickpea polenta, homemade pastas and sauces, risotto and venison are all regional favourites. For dessert, head to Sirmione for the lake’s best gelato.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Lake Garda is a perfect choice for a walking holiday – there’s endless trails here that cater for all abilities. If you’re after gentle strolls, pick Garda or Bardolino as your base. The promenade stretches for miles so you can really get your steps up. You’ll find more challenging routes in the north. <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> has some great paths that wind up the mountains where you can get birds-eye views over the lake.</p>
<p>If you’re serious about cycling, you’ll love Lake Garda. A lot of the promenades here are traffic free so you can relax and enjoy the views. You can cycle around the whole lake in a day if you’re up for it. For the best off-road thrills, head to Riva del Garda or Malcesine.</p>
<p>We love hitting the water in Lake Garda. Windsurfing is very popular in Riva and you can normally see it taking place from the piazza. Get involved and try it yourself. Paddle boarding in Malcesine is a great activity for everyone and gives you a nice, unique view of the town. You can even take a sailing or kite surfing course while you're there.</p>]]></inAround>
