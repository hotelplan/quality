  <description><![CDATA[<p>Limone sits on the shores of Lake Garda, the village is built into the foothills of the Dolomite Mountains near Trento. It’s a romantic village of old houses, winding alleys, flowered balconies, shops, taverns, bars and restaurants, with a church dating back to the 10th century. In the summer, a weekly market sells local products - lemons, olive oil, wine, cheese - and a fishermen’s museum tells the story of Limone’s history. </p>
<h3>Walking is a great way to explore the Limone landscape</h3>
<p>Easy lakeside trails and challenging walks stretch from lake-level up to 1,000 metres around Limone. There are no gondola's so if you want those summer views from the top you'll need to work hard, but it's very rewarding! Whatever path you choose, the views are immense.</p>
<h3>Boat tours of Lake Garda and visits to surrounding towns</h3>
<p>Taking a boat to and from Limone is where you’ll get the best views of the village, especially in the summer. The ferries are a quick way to visit other areas around Lake Garda, and you can take tours that follow the coastline and its historic spots, docking at other charming Lake Garda villages. By using the boats to reach other towns in Lake Garda means you can reach plenty of other walking starting points too! </p>
<h3>Italian food &amp; wine</h3>
<p>The food and wine scene in Limone is great! Head out to local restaurants and bars for the best food and atmosphere. We'd recommend looking for an off the beaten track restaurant, for the most authentic Italian food and drink. Lake Garda is famous for its vineyards, with traditions and roots in the Bronze Age; try Aperitivo Chiarè, a pink sparkling wine spritzer made from local rosé, or a glass of classic Bardolino - you just can't beat a glass on a warm summers day. For a small village, there are a surprising number of good bars in Limone.</p>
<h3>Biking around Limone</h3>
<p>In 2018 the Limone sul Garda section of the Ciclopista del Garda (Garda Cycle Path) was completed, and takes you on a stunning lakeside trail along Limone’s coastline, you can also walk along too if you fancy a slower paced option. The path is built into the rocky cliffs, hanging 50 metres above Lake Garda. You can even cycle on it at night, thanks to LED flood lighting. Head inland and there’s a paradise of dirt tracks and mule paths for mountain biking, and kilometres more paved roads for cycling.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Limone with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Limone's best activities at your own pace.</span></p>

Join a professional mountain guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</span></p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Ciclopedonale Limone</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy with some uphill sections </li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> approx. 2 hours </li>
<li>Perfect photo point at Limonaia (old lemon greenhouses), where you can see Limone from afar as well as the lake and the mountains</li>
</ul>
<p><span>This walk begins from the Limone Centro Ferry Port, where you continue for around 30 minutes before reaching the start of the walk. The route can be travelled on by foot or bike. Part of the route overhangs the lake where you can enjoy breath-taking views suspended between the lake and the sky. Break up the walk with a gelato along the way.</span></p>
<h3>Cascata Di Sopino</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Moderate with some uphill sections </li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6 km</li>
<li>Gorgeous landscapes </li>
</ul>
<p><span>This walk begins from Nova Street, behind Hotel All'Azzurro. A real delight is when you reach the Sopino Waterfall with a 15 metre drop, it is a feast for the eyes. Along the hike, you'll pass gorgeous landscapes with lemon plantations and olive groves. </span></p>
<h3>Un Percorso Nella Natura - A Natural Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4.5km</li>
<li>Spot the local sight of the Statue Bridge ''San Giovanni''</li>
</ul>
<p>A route filled with pleasant rambles, varied terrain and uphill sections. Admire the amazing views of Lake Garda and the vegetation around Limone Sul Garda. The trail is well marked with maps showing where you are throughout. </p>
<h3>Limone &amp; the Singol Valley</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Very challenging</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 11km</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 700 metres </li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Asphalt surfaces, dirt tracks, natural trails, loose rocky terrain, narrow mountain paths, shere drops</li>
<li>Incredible views of Limone and the Singol Valley from above</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from the centre of Limone the walk heads up alongside the San Giovanni torrent to the Dosso dei Roveri. The walk is a constant ascent from Limone up to the Dosso dei Roveri and has a fantastic panoramic viewpoint over Limone once you reach the top. You'll walk along a historical route which runs along a road built by the Italians during the First World War. This route isn't for the faint hearted but if you love a challenge and are desperate to get views of Limone right from the top then it's worth the effort!</p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Traditional Italian Dining</h3>
<p>Limone is filled with traditional restaurants using the lemons that grow all around. There is an abundance of choice of traditional Italian cuisine to be enjoyed, whilst sitting back and enjoying the wonderful views Lake Garda has to offer. A perfect time to enjoy after a morning of hiking in Limone. </p>
<h3>Historical sights</h3>
<p>There’s lots of little nooks to explore in Limone. The Church of Saint Rocco is a hidden gem. We love visiting the oil mill for some tastings. Take a visit to Limonaia Del Castel to learn about the town’s history with the citrus fruit. Or take a visit the free tourist museum to learn why the residents in Limone live longer thanks to their genes. </p>
<h3>Enjoy local discounts and exploring Lake Garda</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the Garda Promotion Gard, available from your hotel. It's valid for three days and gives you special discounts and reduced rates for the ferries, museums, castles and other attractions. Limone’s not too far from <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a> so we recommend hopping onto a ferry and visiting the town. Make sure you head up Monte Baldo if you’re a fan of walking and great views! <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> is easy to get to, too. You can also pre-book our Tour of Lake Garda excursion to see even more of the lake during your stay.</p>

These lead through fragrant pine forests onto stunning mountain trails with views over the Lake.</p>\n<p>You can opt to stay lower down and weave your way through more shaded areas, stroll to the olive oil factory or walk along the sky bridge that heads down towards the Northern part of the Lake.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for something more challenging, the mountain paths ascend through to the trees to dramatic views and you can summit the mountains behind. These paths are narrower and not for the faint hearted however the breath-taking vistas make the hard work worthwhile.'</p>",
