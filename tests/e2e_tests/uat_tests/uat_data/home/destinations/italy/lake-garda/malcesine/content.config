  <description><![CDATA[<p>Holidays in Malcesine offer a picturesque tourist town of cobbled lanes, medieval architecture and the ancient Scaligero castle. In fact, churches, castles and fortresses dot the shores of <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, taking sightseeing to new levels with the beautiful backdrop of lake and mountains. Treat yourself and taste the authentic flavours from the Italian restaurants in this family holiday setting. Malcesine is full of courtyards, gardens, trattorias, shops, gelaterie and bars that create a lively town atmosphere in the summer; great fun for children and adults alike! </p>
<h3>Family walking in Malcesine</h3>
<p>Set your sights high and take the cable car running from Malcesine to Monte Baldo - a perfect excursion for a summer day, with cooler temperatures and a breeze guaranteed. At the top you’ll find walking and biking trails of all levels with wonderful views over Lake Garda, as well as several restaurants. The range of trails here make it ideal for families, it's easy to find a route that's manageable for little legs, or if you have teenagers, they'll love trying out some of the more exciting biking routes. Mid-way, the cable car stops at San Michele, where you can amble back down to Malcesine on a mule track getting maximum views with minimal effort.</p>
<h3>The prettiest town on Lake Garda?</h3>
<p>It’s a hard one to call, Lake Garda being so beautiful (and one of Italy’s best loved summer holiday spots), but summer holidays in Malcesine really do stand out from the crowd. Scaligero castle is built on a rock jutting over the lake, with fantastic views all around. There’s the Palazzo dei Capitani near the port - with its waterfront gardens, natural history museum and paintings - the 1200-year-old church Antica Pieve di Santo Stefano, and the huge white statue of Madonna dell’Accoglienze looking over the town (a relatively easy 8km round-trip walk from town).</p>
<h3>Lakeside beaches and dreamy islands</h3>
<p>Just 100m from the centre of Malcesine is pebbly Paina beach, with lifeguards, volleyball courts, a skate park, bars, restaurants and a beach club. It's a must-do on a hot summer day. Wander up the coast and the beaches multiply; most have floating swim rafts and a pizzeria close by. A few kilometres south of town is Val di Sogno beach, and when the lake water is low you can walk over to Isola del Sogno - ‘Dream Island’ - or even swim to it just 20 metres from the shore. Scuba divers might like to rent gear and visit the boat wreck just beyond Isola del Sogno.</p>
<h3>Family days out: exploring Lake Garda from Malcesine</h3>
<p>Malcesine is a great jumping off point for visiting the other Lake Garda towns and the perfect town for those who want to explore on holiday. Catch the boat over to the western shores of the lake to <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c}" title="Limone">Limone</a> for more ancient architecture and a different perspective of Garda. From Limone, stroll along the new cycle-pedestrian path, which is suspended over the water, hugging the cliffs - this is a really stunning walk an easy route for all ages.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cable Car</strong></p>
<p>Monte Baldo cable car is particularly useful if you want to head up high and immerse yourself in nature, walking or biking. The cable car is within walking distance from our hotels (10-35 mins) and there are local buses which will take you there from the further out hotels in under 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
<p>The bus network around Malcesine is particularly useful if you’re staying in one of our further out hotels, you can get to the centre of town and the ferry departure point in under 15 minutes on the bus and it will get you closer to the Monte Baldo Cable Car. While the buses are useful, we’d also recommend walking, as it’s the best way to really get to know an area and none of our hotels are more than a 25 minute walk from the centre of town. Some of the walking routes are mostly along the lakeside so you’ll have a lovely view to enjoy along the way.</p>
<p>The buses also run from Malcesine to nearby towns on <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> such as <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> which you can get to in under half an hour on a direct bus (484). The same bus line travels in the other direction as well and can get you to Garda in under 45 minutes. This is a more cost efficient way of exploring nearby towns.</p>
<p><strong>Ferry</strong></p>
<p>Looking to explore further afield? The ferries depart from the centre of Malcesine regularly and are a scenic way to visit other towns around the lake such as <a data-udi="umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c}" title="Limone">Limone</a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a>. The ferry timetable can be found on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/" target="_blank">Navigazione Laghi website</a>.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <listingDescription><![CDATA[<p>Malcesine is one of Lake Garda's prettiest towns, thanks to its recognisable 13th Century castle. Cobbled streets and little cafés give it a really romantic feel. It's also a great place to go if you're looking for an active holiday. The cable car goes to the top of Monte Baldo where you can set off on a mountain walk or bike ride. Head down the coast slightly and you can try some paddle boarding or even learn how to sail. There's also so much for families to do in Malcesine, with fun activities for all age groups. </p>
<p><strong>Best for: </strong>all walking abilities; nature; sightseeing; activities; families</p>]]></listingDescription>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p><strong>La Rocchetta</strong></p>
<p>This is a relatively easy route which takes you up some steep mountain roads and onto some decent paths all the way up to the statue of the Madonna dell’Accoglienza. On the way you’ll get views of Malcesine from above and the famous Scaligero castle. We love seeing the town from a different perspective!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Distance: </strong>2.9km (walking time approx. 1 hour)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 275 metres </li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Asphalt surfaces, forested trails, walking paths, ascents and descents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chiesa San Michele</strong></p>
<p>Head up to the old San Michele chapel on this loop walk. The chapel was first documented in the 12<sup>th</sup> Century by Hadrian IV and over hundreds of years was neglected and fell into ruin. It was then restored in 1908. You’ll start in Malcesine on a steep path up the Monte Baldo mountain heading towards the Monte Baldo cable car middle station. From here you’ll head up to the chapel from which there are fantastic views of Malcesine from above. See if you can spot the Scaligero castle when you’re up there!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.6km (walking time approx. 2.5 hours)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent: </strong>525 metres </li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Asphalt surfaces, forested trails, walking paths, ascents and descents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Crest of Monte Baldo</strong></p>
<p>Fancy walking along the top of Monte Baldo and its peaks? Then this is the walk for you. The end point for this walk is the <a href="https://www.equipenatura.it/rifugio-telegrafo-monte-baldo-lago-di-garda/?utm_source=360gardalife&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=360gardalife">Rifugio Telegrafo</a> at 2147 metres, a mountain hut right at the top of Monte Baldo which overlooks the whole of Lake Garda. The walk starts at the top Monte Baldo Cable car station (Baita dei Forti) and you’ll end up following path 651 which leads to the mountain hut. Throughout the walk you’ll be completely immersed in the sublime mountain scenery, hiking above the clouds and the lake. This is one of the most stunning walks on Monte Baldo, but you have to be a very confident walker and very comfortable with steep mountain side ascents, shere drops and narrow paths.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 18.5km (walking time approx. 7 hours)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 1, 183 metres </li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Mountainside paths, rocky terrain, steep ascents and descents</li>
</ul>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Where the foothills of the Alps meet the shores of Lake Garda sits one of Italy’s prettiest villages, Malcesine, where you can enjoy your family summer holiday by relaxing or walking]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>History in Malcesine </h3>
<p>Scaligero Castle is a must-see in Malcesine. It’s been there since the 13th Century so history buffs will love walking around and reading about it’s interesting past. Head to museum to find out more. Before you go back into town, make the climb to the top of the tower where the lake views are incredible – don’t forget your camera. Palazzo dei Capitani is probably the second most important historic building in the town. In the 15th Century it was the headquarters for the Venetian rulers of the area. It’s close to the harbour and once you’ve finished exploring inside, you can admire the lake views from the gardens.</p>
<h3>Eating and drinking in Lake Garda</h3>
<p>A favourite past time for tourists in Malcesine is eating and drinking. The harbour and lakeside is filled with cafés and bars offering fresh food and local wines. Pull up a chair and order your favourite dish as you people-watch or look out over the lake. We'd recommend trying a glass of Bardolino red and a big plate of bigoli – a long, thick spaghetti-like pasta from the Italy's Veneto region.</p>
<h3>Walking is the best way to find those great Malcesine views</h3>
<p>Lakeside strolls in either direction from town will give you 10/10 scenery, but if you’re keen to up the ante and take on a challenge, look no further than Monte Altissimo di Nago. These are the highest peaks of Monte Baldo directly above Malcesine. You can see for miles up here and get 360 degree panoramas. Skip the long, steep climb by taking the cable car and follow signs to Monte Altissimo, stopping at the Bocca Navene rifugio for Italian snacks en route. The Walk of the Little Stone Men is also a great route to do – it’s less than five kilometres and great for all abilities.</p>
<p>The famous Busatte Tempesta path is a moderate trail, starting a few kilometres north of Malcesine. With walkways and railings built for easy-access, you’ll still need your energy for the 400 stairs en route. Take it at your own speed, because it’s worth every step for the scenery and lake views. Tired legs can take a bus back to town - or switch it up and do the walk in reverse, downhill.</p>
<p>Check out some more great walking routes by heading to the 'Walking Tab'.</p>
<h3>Activites in Malcesine </h3>
<p>There’s nothing quite like jumping on your saddle and peddling along side Lake Garda. It’s such a relaxing thing to do and a great way to build up your appetite! We'd recommend a leisurely bike ride along the shore to one of Malcesine’s nearby resorts where you can stop for lunch. If all that sounds a bit tame, then take to the sky. The top of Monte Baldo has some great, thrill-seeking routes down the mountain.</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to resist taking to the water in Malcesine. Paddle boarding is a great activity for everyone and gives you a nice, unique view of the town. Get more serious and take a sailing or kite surfing course. It’s always nice to come back from holiday with a few new skills.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p><strong>Hiking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains and lakes are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help them stay that way, and remain enjoyable and safe places for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:</li>
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<p><strong>Why we love walking in Malcesine</strong></p>
<p>Malcesine is one of the best equipped resorts on Lake Garda when it comes to getting out onto some walking trails. From walking along the lakeside towards towns such as Navene and Campagnola (Northbound) and heading up in the Monte Baldo cable car to discover a plethora of mountain walks with fantastic views of Lake Garda’s fjord-like natural form.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
