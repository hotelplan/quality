<p>Lake Como truly comes to life during the summer months with vibrant festivals, culture and artistic events. Sagra de San Giovanni is the summer festival in the last week of June that celebrates Como’s wonderful history, through music, folk culture, art and food. Como Summer Festival is a big festival of music with concerts being held in a variety of unusual and unique venues across the lake. From classical music to modern jazz and pop music, it’s not an event to be missed! For any car enthusiasts out there, you may have heard of the internationally renowned Concorso d’Eleganza car festival. A truly luxurious event that is often for invited guests only but spectators are allowed to come along and see the fantastic array of rare and one-off super cars.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
