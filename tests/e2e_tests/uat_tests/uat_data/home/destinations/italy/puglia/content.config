  <description><![CDATA[<p>This sleepy region is the rising star of the Italian south. We love the authenticity here - drive past olive groves and ancient family farms then try the food they make in the restaurants and trattoria. The towns all offer something different so visit as many as you can - it's a tough call to pick our favourites but Polignano a Mare and Ostuni are unmissable. This is a great place to dust off your walking boots or jump on a bike too. It's quite flat and there's some great country trails where you can slow down and appreciate the views. </p>
<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>What to see on a Puglia Holiday</strong></p>
<p>This south-eastern stripe of Italy is where you’ll find some of the best examples of southern baroque architecture. Gold-hued Lecce is nicknamed the Florence of the South. An ivory-white cathedral watches over the harbour in Trani. And Gallipoli is full of beach clubs with renowned seafood restaurants (the local lobster is a must-try). Don’t forget the town of Alberobello – a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a distinctive skyline of conical-roofed trulli.</p>

  <inAround><![CDATA[<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Things to see and do</strong></p>
<p>Puglia's best explored by car. It's incredible driving past the olive groves and hidden beach clubs before stopping for a bite to eat in a seaside restaurant. Here are our top places to visit while you're here:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bari: </em>This busy port town has tonnes of history and culture. Watch the fishermen bring in their catch, walk through the old town past nonnas making orecchiette pasta and enjoy lunch in an unfussy trattoria.</li>
<li><em>Locorotondo: </em>This is one of Puglia’s prettiest towns with whitewashed buildings, little piazzas and streets that give way to panoramic views over the Valle d’Itria.</li>
<li><em>Polignano a Mare: </em>A lively seaside town built into the cliff side with amazing sea views, some of the best gelaterias in Puglia and tucked-away coves that are perfect for sunbathing.</li>
<li><em>Castellana Caves: </em>Take a guided tour through these impressive limestone caves. The journey spans three kilometres through extraordinary sights of stalactite and stalacmite formations.</li>
<li><em>Lecce: </em>Known as the ‘Florence of the South’, Lecce is filled with stunning baroque architecture and over 2,000 years of history to explore.</li>
<li>Alberobello: A UNESCO-protected site, Alberobello’s unique landscape of trulli houses makes it a popular tourist attraction. This pretty town is a pleasure to wander around, ducking in and out of the conical-roofed buildings that have been turned into bars, cafés and shops.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Food &amp; drink</strong></p>
<p>Puglia's a farmer’s region so the food here is taken straight from the field to your table and locally-sourced produce is the star of the show. Most of Italy’s olive oil comes from Puglia and you’ll see olive trees wherever you look, some more than 1,000 years old! Pasta's very popular here, often accompanied with fresh vegetables. Seafood is also readily available and you’ll find plenty of restaurants along the coastline that range from little family-run places to upmarket, fine dining restaurants.</p>
<p>If you enjoy full-bodied reds then you’ll be in your element in Puglia. Our favourite is Primitivo but Negroamaro deserves a mention too – it can be traced back to the 6th century!</p>
<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Activities</strong></p>
<p>Grab your boots for some fab walking routes in Puglia. Head off the beaten track and find the country trails between the hilltop towns or along the coast. The area's also great for cycling. Head down the Adriatica Cycleway for over 500 kilometres of coastal paths, or go inland to the a<span>queduct paths that cut through the countryside for miles of traffic-free, mostly flat trails.</span></p>]]></inAround>
