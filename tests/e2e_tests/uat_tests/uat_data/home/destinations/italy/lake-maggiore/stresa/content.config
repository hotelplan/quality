  <description><![CDATA[<p>Borromean island views, Michelin-recommended restaurants and historic hotels – it’s easy to see why Stresa is <a data-udi="umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48" href="/{localLink:umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48}" title="Lake Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a>’s most popular spot. Come summer, it’s abuzz with people soaking up the atmosphere of the old town and promenade and walking atop Mount Mottarone. This once sleepy fishing village was transformed by the Borromeo family, who planted palaces and gardens on the now-famous Borromean Islands just offshore. Another transformation came with the arrival of the Venice-Simplon Orient Express railway and its prosperous passengers. Grand hotels, villas and gardens sprung up that still decorate the town today. Walking holidays to Stresa explore all of this, as well as the picturesque paths beyond.</p>
<h3>Walking in Stresa </h3>
<p>Royalty, philosophers, musicians and writers (Hemingway included) have all been wooed by Stresa’s marvellous views. Walkers love Stresa for the same reasons too. Mount Mottarone towers beside the town and stands between Lake Maggiore and Lake Orta. With Sweeping views over Lake Maggiore and the Borromean Islands – and, on a clear day, you may even get a glimpse of up to seven shimmering Italian and Swiss lakes. Look out for the Alps in the distance too! </p>
<h3>Easy sightseeing: catch a boat to the Borromean Islands</h3>
<p>The Borromean Islands are opposite Stresa, just ten minutes away by ferry. Explore the main island of Isola Bella, with its baroque palace, terraced gardens and dusting of white peacocks. Boats also bustle across the water to Isola Madre, where you can ramble between carefully cultivated magnolia groves, wisteria walkways, palm gardens and lily ponds. Isola dei Pescatori is the odd island out – home to a busy fishing village with a cluster of trattorias and shops, it’s a true taste of the old Lake Maggiore.</p>
<h3>Finding food: refuel with lake and mountain fare</h3>
<p>A mix of pizzerias, panini lunch stops and family-friendly restaurants fill the narrow streets that run from the waterfront. Piazza Cadorna is the heart of the old town; pull up a chair in a sunny spot for antipasti plates piled high with cheeses and cured meats from Piedmont. Plus, a handful of places in Stresa are recommended by the Michelin guide, thanks to their ingenious takes on local lake and mountain cuisine. We'd recommend trying out the unassuming foodie spots, off the tourist trails, they tend to be where you'll find the most authentic and delicious food and drink!</p>
<h3>Villas and the Venice-Simplon Orient Express</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Simplon Pass opened and Stresa became a stop on the Venice-Simplon Orient Express Line. Every summer wealthy visitors began to flock in – and the town welcomed them by building grand hotels along the waterfront. Some of the villa gardens and extravagant mansions are open to curious wanderers. The Simplon line still exists, too. The trains that pull into Stresa station are more rustic nowadays, but you can still be amongst the stylish streets and shopping arcades of <a data-udi="umb://document/2575554a5b50446eb00d5bf533f317cd" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2575554a5b50446eb00d5bf533f317cd}" title="Milan">Milan</a> in less than an hour.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The hydro-foil ferries in Lake Maggiore are extremely useful and more eco-friendly than your average ferry! They're perfect for hopping over to the Borromean islands for a day trip. From Stresa you can nip over to Isola Bella in about 10 minutes! Check out those sparkling waters as you drift along the lake. Many of our hotels are close to ferry landing points, so you won't have far to go.</p>
<h3>Buses &amp; trains</h3>
<p>Stresa's bus network is really useful for exploring towns like <a data-udi="umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005" href="/{localLink:umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005}" title="Baveno">Baveno</a> which takes around eight minutes on the bus. You can usually buy tickets in a nearby tabaccheria or on the bus itself. You can also get the train to nearby towns such as Belgirate, with its little Romanesque church of St Mary dating back to the 11th Century. This journey only takes about 12 minutes direct.</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>If you'd rather walk, it doesn't take long to walk along the lakeside to picture perfect towns such as Feriolo with its little beaches and quaint harbours. This walk takes about 1 hour 30 minutes and passes through Baveno.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Il Sentiero Azzurro</h3>
<p>Walk up to the Romanesque stone church of St Giovanni in the field - worth having a look to see if it's open. Once you get to the Belvedere viewing point you'll get some incredible views of Lake Maggiore, The Borromean Gulf and the mouth of the River Toce, so it's worth taking a minute and soaking it all in. The trail is signposted for some of the way as the Sentiero Azzurro and if you follow it after the viewpoint, you'll come to a lakeside path with sections shaded by trees. Make sure you take some time to visit the archaeological museum along the lakeside path, and take a moment to sit in one of the relaxing lakeside cafe's for a coffee or a spritz!</p>
<p>To start the walk you can hop on a train or ferry to Verbania/Pallanza from Stresa and then you'll walk to Mergozzo town via Montorfano. Don't forget to validate your ticket on the platform before hopping on the train!</p>
<h3>Villa Lesa - Monte Alle Croci - Belgirate</h3>
<p>Starting in the relaxed town of Lesa this walk gives you a diverse range of things to see along the way. Stroll through the ancient villages of the Upper Vergante, stumble across farmhouses and churches and head into the foothills around Lake Maggiore, passing the Erno stream as well as historic villages, villas and gardens on the way. The walk is about 11.5km long and has about 480 metres of ascent, so requires a very good fitness level. The walk ends in Belgirate, where you can grab a train directly back to Stresa, this is about 12 minutes direct.</p>
<p>Hop on the train from Stresa to Lesa where the walk starts, the journey only takes about 11 minutes direct. </p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Stresa is the gateway to the Borromean Islands – and to some of the best views and walking trails on Lake Maggiore]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Things to See and Do</h3>
<p>A trip to Stresa wouldn't be complete without visiting at least one of the three Borromean Islands. The Isola Bella's the most famous island and was turned into an Italian terraced garden in the 17th Century by the Borromeo family. It's so beautiful that it's inspired writers and poets throughout time. Dickens wrote, "However fanciful and fantastic Isola Bella may be, and is, it is still beautiful". Isola Madre's the biggest island and has peacocks strutting around its' gardens. Check out the villa and its classic Italian style. The third island, Isola dei Pescatori is a lot more down to earth. It's an old fishing island and still is today. This is where Maggiore gets it's delicious fresh fish. It's easy to get to these islands on the ferry (services reduce to weekends only in October) or by water taxi.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a day trip, you're only a stones throw away from Lake Orta, the famous UNESCO world heritage site. The smallest of the lakes, it's definitely worth a visit with it's relatively untouched landscape and fantastic food!</p>
<h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>
<p>The fish in Lake Maggiore's a must try, with the Isola dei Pescatori on your doorstep, you can have fresh fish everyday. Perch is very popular in the area and tends to be eaten in breaded filets, or if you're looking for something a bit more familiar, you could have trout which is typically served with home-made mayonnaise.</p>
<p>The cheese in Lake Maggiore's some of the best in Italy. It's on the border of Switzerland so both places share fantastic mountain land for raising cattle and making delicious cheese- they even produce one you'll definitely recognise... gorgonzola. The local cured meats are also excellent and fantastic on an antipasto platter with the cheese. You have to try it! </p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Are you into water sports? Do you love hiking up to the best view-points? Then you'll never be bored in Stresa! Why not try out wake-boarding, water-skiing or paddle-boarding or you could hike the Chestnut Route (Sentiero dei Castagni) up Mount Mottarone which takes about 4 hours 30 minutes. The view from the top is unforgettable and on a clear day you can see seven of the Italian and Swiss lakes.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
