  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hotel Brunelleschi is one of the most iconic hotels in <a data-udi="umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b}" title="Florence">Florence</a>. Its Pagliazza Tower can be dated back to the sixth century and the interior is still formed of exposed stone, wooden beams, large arched windows and vaulted ceilings. There’s an incredible history in these walls and you can learn all about it in the hotel’s private museum. It shows the painstaking reconstruction process that took place to uncover the Roman ruins of a Calidarium, before it became a hotel.</p>
<p>The interiors of this hotel are stunning and it's been awarded the Top Luxury Boutique Hotel in Europe for 2019 by TripAdvisor. Expect luxurious rooms with Baroque furnishings, local artwork and designer furniture. Upgrade to a Duomo view room for something really special. We love eating in the Tower Bar for a casual dinner or aperitivo. If you’re celebrating an occasion or just feel like spoiling yourself, head to the gourmet restaurant, Santa Elisabetta. It’s one of Florence's finest and has two Michelin stars!</p>
<p>Hotel Brunelleschi's perfectly located for exploring. Your first port of call should be the Via dei Calzaiuoli, a pedestrianised district in the shadow of the Duomo. There are both designer boutiques and local shops - some of which are run by family names dating back to the 15th century. Some fantastic cafes such as Sebatino, famed for their espressos, and ice cream shops such as Gelateria dei Neri are firm local favourites. The limoncello sorbet and honeycomb ice cream from Gelateria dei Neri are amazing!</p>
<p>Transfer time: approx. 30 minutes by private car from Florence airport or approx. 1 hour 20 mins by bus &amp; train or private car from Pisa airport.</p>]]></description>
