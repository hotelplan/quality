  <description><![CDATA[<p><span>Hotel Costa Dei Fiori is the ideal choice for an easy-going and relaxed holiday. Basing yourself here on <a data-udi="umb://document/cc3361d2d7a945d38852da5e20516d75" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cc3361d2d7a945d38852da5e20516d75}" title="Southern Sardinia">Southern Sardinia's</a> beautiful coast in Santa Margherita di Pula, you'll be surrounded by nature. The hotel's set in tropical, palm filled, gardens that edge the sea. There's enough space for it to feel quiet and private. The three pool areas are lovely - our favourite has to be the infinity pool that looks out over the clear blue sea. The main pool at the centre of the resort is nice too - treat yourself to a refreshing fruit smoothie from the bar while you relax beside it on a comfy sun lounger. If you're travelling with your little ones, the shallow kid's pool is just beside a nice grassy area - perfect for playing. </span></p>
<p><span>The rooms are in traditional Sardinian villas, dotted about the gardens. They're simple and spacious, decorated in crisp whites and blues, with cool tiled floors and artisan, hand crafted wooden furniture - it all feels very typically Sardinian. If you can, upgrade to on of the superior rooms - they have their own private patio or a terrace - lovely for sitting out in the evenings. If you choose to upgrade to half board or fancy dinner at the hotel, you'll dine at the restaurant beside the pool. The food is excellent - we'd definitely recommend attending the Sardinian dinner they hold once a week! </span></p>
<p><span>You'll be spoiled for choice when it comes to sandy beaches. The Sardinian coast is renowned for its beautiful white sand and Chia Bay, only a short drive away, won't disappoint. The hotel even run a shuttle service to get you there (payable locally). We do recommend hiring a car while you're here though, as there is so much to see in the surrounding area. Like the medieval monuments of Cagliari, the archaeological park at Nora and the natural grottos of Santadi - it's nice to have the freedom to see it all at your own pace.</span></p>
<p>Car hire is recommended for this hotel. Hotel Costa Dei Fiori is approx. 1 hour from Cagliari airport.</p>]]></description>

  <facilityDescription><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pools &amp; Beaches</strong></span></p>
<p>The hotel has two saltwater pools, as well as a children's pool, for you to choose from during your stay. They're all surrounded by plenty of sun beds and if you want to get out of the heat of the sun you'll find lots of lovely shady areas beneath the palm trees.</p>
<p>The pool close to the hotel's main building is surrounded by greenery and the bar beside it is open all day. We found it hard to tare ourselves away - especially when the staff serve delicious fruit smoothies and tasty cocktails to the poolside. The other pool is an infinity pool - it's a pretty special spot that looks out across the crystal clear sea. </p>
<p>The children's pool is shallower, so the kids can splash about safely. There's a nice grassy area beside the pool too, so it's perfect for playing and making new friends. </p>
<p><strong>Chia Bay</strong></p>
<p>There's lots of great beaches just a short drive from the hotel. Chia Bay is about 15 kilometres away - it's been awarded the most beautiful beach in Italy! We can see why - its surrounded by sand dunes and has beautiful white sand that's lapped by the clear blue sea. There's places where you can hire canoes and snorkelling equipment, or even have a surf lesson. It's a really nice area for walking too, with lots of beautiful unspoiled coves to stumble upon - some of them are only reachable on foot. The hotel runs a shuttle service here for a small local fee.</p>
<p><strong>Tuerredda Beach</strong></p>
<p>About 20 minutes drive from the hotel you'll find the beautiful little sheltered cove of Turredda. Spend a day here relaxing on the soft fine sand. It's hard not to be mesmerised by the ever changing shades of the water all mottled in turquoises and blues. </p>
<p><strong>Cala Zafferano Beach</strong></p>
<p>The only way to reach this beautiful remote beach is by boat. You can hire your own or take a boat trip (bookable and payable locally). The sand's made up of lots of glistening shell fragments and the water is so clear. </p>
