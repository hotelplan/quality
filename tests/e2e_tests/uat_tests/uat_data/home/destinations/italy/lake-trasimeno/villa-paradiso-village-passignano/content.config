  <description><![CDATA[<p>Just metres above the turquoise waters of <a data-udi="umb://document/24a88c57973b4e2c9dfbd2e6a719afde" href="/{localLink:umb://document/24a88c57973b4e2c9dfbd2e6a719afde}" title="Lake Trasimeno">Lake Trasimeno</a> sits the cozy and traditional Villa Paradiso Village. Steeped in verdant gardens and perched slightly above the lake, this ancient former Umbrian farmhouse has been renovated and extended to create a wonderful family friendly accommodation. The traditional stone interior has a rustic and authentic feel with bright and airy rooms as well as extensive gardens in which you can find a gorgeous outdoor pool with plenty of sun loungers and parasols, a tennis court and a children's club and playground. Bedrooms are spacious and offer excellent value for money with larger rooms sleeping up to four which is ideal for families. </p>
<p>Offering full board, the onsite restaurant is a buffet service for breakfast and dinner with the former consisting of a vast continental selection as well as daily hot options. Dinner is a traditional Italian affair and with fresh pasta dishes, gnocci, meat and fish with plenty of fresh salads from the buffet, there is certainly something for everyone. The piano bar from which you can order from a plethora of Italian liquers, wines, local beer and soft drinks is included in your board basis and provides live music three times a week. </p>
<p>For those wanting to get out and about, the village centre of Passignano is just a 7 minute walk away where you can locate the bus stop to travel to Perugia or simply out to discover more of the stunning countryside Villa Paradiso is surrounded by. In the town as well as boutique shops selling traditional wares, you'll find stunning baroque architecture and some superb little cafes ideal for stopping off to enjoy a coffee or Aperol Spritz. </p>

<p>The onsite restaurant at Villa Paradiso is a bright and airy space with large windows opening up onto the flourishing gardens. All meals are served in a buffet style with plenty of hot and cold options to choose from and something to suit every taste. </p>
<p>Breakfast offers a rich and varied continental selection of hot and cold options including English breakfast, pastries, cakes, breads and cereals and dinner consists of wonderfully traditional options such as melon with parma ham, fresh pasta, homemade soups and fragrant fish dishes all accompanied by a salad buffet and delectable dessert cart which includes fresh fruit and cream cakes.

<p>The bar at Villa Paradiso is small and cozy with plenty of local Italian spirits, liquers, beers and soft drinks on offer and live music three times per week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pools and Beaches</span></p>
<p>The large pool nestled in Villa Paradiso's verdant gardens offers tranquility and relaxation in the Umbrian sun. With a separate pool for children and plenty of sun loungers and parasols, this makes for the perfect spot to kick back after a day exploring the cobbled streets of Passignano and soak up the sunshine. </p>
<p>If you want to head out into the azure waters of Traismeno itself, there is a superb local beach just 2 kilometres away by the name of Sualzo. Unlike most lakeside beaches, this one boasts a sandy shore and plenty of space with pine trees lining the shore and even a swimming dock so you can lay in the middle of the lake to take in the incredible scenery. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Activities</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>As a family friendly hote, the Villa Paradiso offers children's clubs throughout the season for various ages. The 'Mini-Club- for children aged 4 -12 and 'Junior Club' for children aged 12 - 17 both run from 01 Jun to 31 Aug. This includes indoor and outdoor activities throughout the day with many revolving around sports and the facilities on site such as the pool and tennis court. (Please note that some charges for the children's clubs may apply) </p>
<p>Evening entertainment is included for all guests including children and is usually performed in the bar and garden area. With performances from singers, actors and musicians, this is a wonderful opportunity to relax in the garden and enjoy the sun setting over Trasimeno with your family or friends. *Please note that the evening entertainment runs until 30 Aug. </p>]]></facilityDescription>
