  <description><![CDATA[<p>You know it's good when it's popular with the locals - Kamnik is only 35 minutes from Ljubljana airport, but feels worlds away thanks to the pristine nature, medieval architecture and local traditions. </p>
<h3>Holidays in Kamnik</h3>
<p>One of the most beautiful medieval towns in Slovenia, Kamnik was once a thriving trade town and used to be surrounded by high walls and a moat. Now you'll get lost in its rich history and medieval architecture - the prettiest street in town is Šutna which is lined with traditional signboards and remnants of old crafts and tradespeople. Discover architectural highlights of the town like the pretty chapel at Mali Grad Hill - the last remaining part of an 11th Century Castle. Or the old castle remains at Stari Grad - the views from this panoramic spot stretch for miles on a clear day.</p>
<h3>Kamnik-Savinja Alps: a hiker's paradise</h3>
<p>Lace up your walking boots and get ready to discover ancient mountain pastures, hidden valleys, castle remnants and secret peaks - this is a paradise for exploring on foot. Take a leisurely stroll around the Volčji Potok Arboretum with its thousands of plant and tree species, or escape into nature on the path along the <span>Kamniška Bistrica River. For a breathe of mountain air, head to Velika Planina - one of the most beautiful Alpine pastures in Slovenia, dotted with traditional shepherd's huts. Keen hiker's should follow in the footsteps of the locals - l</span>ike every Slovenian should visit Mount Triglav (the highest peak in Slovenia) at least once in their lives, everyone from Kamnik should visit the Kamnik Saddle - the dip in the mountains between the peaks of Brana and Planjava in the Kamnik-Savinja. </p>
<h3>Kamnik cuisine</h3>
<p>With its rich history and culture, it's no surprise that Kamnik is known for its food and drink. Trnič hard cheese is a must-try - it's from the Velika Planina plateau and is a traditional symbol of love that shepherd's would give to their partner at the end of summer. Sample some local Slovenian food at the Mili Vrh guesthouse just outside Kamnik, and you can try trout from the Tuhinja valley prepared in 10 different ways at the Terme Snovik's own Potočka restaurant. Slovenia is known for its wine, but beer lovers will really love Kamnik - there a four brewery's nearby including the Mali Grad brewery which is the oldest in Kamnik and the Maister brewery which started out with a group of friends home-brewing beer and got out of control.</p>
<h3>Stay at Slovenia's highest spa resort</h3>
<p>There's nothing better than a bit of relaxation after a long walk, and the Terme Snovik is just the ticket. Relax in the thermal indoor and outdoor pools - the water comes from deep in the Earth and is naturally rich in minerals like calcium and magnesium. Sooth achy calves and feet with Kneipp, head to the saunas or treat yourself to a massage.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of great options, and it's tricky to pick our favourites, but here's a few options that we really love:</p>
<h3>Stari Grad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>2.5km with 170m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 30-40 minutes in both directions</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most impressive panorama over Kamnik and the surrounding mountains, this walk is a must-do and is a pretty easy starting point to exploring the area. It starts in the centre of Kamnik town, and takes only around 35 minutes to reach the old castle ruins at Stari Grad - with information on local wildlife along the way, it's a great option for families.</p>
<h3>Velika Planina</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>12.5km with 320m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Slovenia's most beautiful mountain pastures, the Velika Planina is dotted with ancient shepherd's huts, many of which are still used today. A loop of the area, starting from the top of the cable car is a lovely way to explore the area, and you'll pass many huts and the Snow Mary Chapel. Views stretch for miles in all directions and you can refuel at the Zelenci Rob mountain hut.</p>
<h3>Kamnik Saddle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate-challenging walk</li>
<li>5.5km with 1,364m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around six hours</li>
<li>Terrain is steep and rocky in places</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk is on every locals bucket-list for good reason. It starts in the picturesque glacier valley of Kamniška Bistrica and climbs to the mountain hut on the terrace of Kamnik Saddle, between two mountain peaks. At 1,864 metres altitude, you're up in the rugged mountains here, and will notice the fresh air, peace and quiet - and the spectacular views in all directions, of course. At the right time of year, the Alpine flowers on route are beautiful.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Holidays in Kamnik are a cocktail of history and natural beauty, seemingly a hidden gem yet close to Ljubljana, this is authentic Slovenia]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Discover the town of Kamnik</h3>
<p>Kamnik is a medieval town rich in history, and it's easy to spend a day discovering the best bits of the town, from the pretty streets lined with artisan workshops, to the remains of the two castles. The small chapel on Mali Grad Hill is all that remains of the first castle, which is one of the most iconic views in Kamnik and the Stari Grad castle remnants are a popular walking spot, only 30 minutes from the town but offering one of the most picturesque panorama's of surrounding valleys and peaks. Take a trip into Kamnik's history at the Kamnik Regional Museum in the Zaprice Manor or stop by the Mili Vrh guesthouse for some of the best local food in town - it's on the outskirts of Kamnik but is worth the wander.</p>
<h3>Velika Planina</h3>
<p>Thought to be one of the most beautiful Alpine pastures in Slovenia, the Velika Planina is an ancient karst plateau, dotted with around 200 traditional herder's huts. Herder's take their cattle here at the start of June and stay for the summer, the most experienced cow leads the way with a bell round its neck, and at the end of the grazing season, the herder presents his partner some Trnič cheese as a symbol of his love and loyalty to her. Get a glimpse into herding life in the 19th Century in the Preskar Museum Hut or visit the Snow Mary Chapel. As well as the history and tradition on the plateau, you'll enjoy some of the best views of the Kamnik-Savinja Alps.</p>
<h3>Volčji Potok Arboretum</h3>
<p>No matter what time of year you visit the botanical gardens at <span>Volčji Potok Arboretum, you're in for a treat. They have been declared a cultural monument of national importance for it's contribution to the horticultural and architectural heritage of Slovenia, and there's nearly 5,000 species of plants and trees, all meticulously well looked-after. With 86 hectares to explore, it's perfect for leisurely strolls and admiring of plants including 1,200 rose varieties. Don't worry, there's plenty to keep the children entertained too - a large adventure playpark has slides, swings and climbing frames - can you find your way to the middle of the maze?</span></p>
<h3>Tuhinja Valley</h3>
<p>In this quiet, rural valley you'll be at one with nature, exploring the gentle valley paths, romantic forests and pastures - people have made a living from farming here for many years. Several marked paths lead up to the Alpine pastures of the Menina Plateau - a sub-alpine karst plateau with hidden caves and sinkholes, it's a peaceful spot to enjoy a walk - find your way to the secret peak for some incredible views. The valley is also home to the Snovik Spa, the highest altitude spa in Slovenia, where you can relax the day away and enjoy some me-time.</p>
<h3><span>Kamniška Bistrica</span></h3>
<p>One of the cleanest rivers in Slovenia flows the length of Kamniška Bistrica Valley, the pristine waters are perfect for a paddle. Discover springs and gorges, or head into one of the side valleys to see the 30-metre high Orglice Waterfall - keep an eye out for eagles on this walk as they used to nest in the cliffs by the falls.</p>
<p><span>At the head of the valley, keen hiker's can embark on Kamnik's must-do hike for the locals - it's said that everyone from Kamnik must visit the Kamnik Saddle at least once in their lives - it's easy to see why, a beautiful walk is rewarded with spectacular views down the valley and tasty food in the mountain hut.</span><span></span></p>
<h3>Biking in Kamnik</h3>
<p>Exploring Kamnik on two wheels is just as good as on two feet - it's a paradise for cyclists. Whether you head into the Kamniška Bistrica Valley and cycle along the trail to the river head, or tackle some of the more challenging trails in the forest, you'll definitely have a smile on your face. Or, challenge yourself to the ascent to the Velika Planina plateau - if you don't fancy the steep ascent by bike or foot, you can hop on the cable-car instead, but it is a rewarding climb. </p>]]></thingsToDo>
