  <description><![CDATA[<p>Name a lake in Slovenia, and most will point to the famously photogenic <a data-udi="umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e}" title="Lake Bled">Lake Bled</a> – but there’s another, wilder and equally beautiful, lake just west and it is the perfect spot for a summer holiday. Lake Bohinj basks in the untamed nature of Triglav National Park, where footpaths lead between stone villages, rugged mountains, rushing rivers and forested lakeshores. Amongst these atmospheric, lesser-trodden trails, it’s easy to believe that this is the realm of the mythical gold-horned chamois (and the less mythical eagle and ibex).</p>
<h3>Walking in the Triglav National Park</h3>
<p>The mountains might be dramatic, but much of walking around Lake Bohinj is easy-going. Footpaths ramble between forests and wildflower meadows, waterfalls and caves, and hamlets decorated with half-timbered houses, stone bridges and churches. Mostnica Gorge is a hiking highlight, awash with rapids and waterfalls, as well as the myth-wreathed Devil’s Bridge. There are plenty of challenges too - look up (and up) to the surrounding limestone peaks of the Julian Alps. Height-loving hikers can clamber up the rocky paths to Mount Vogel – or there’s always the cable car that takes you to the restaurant and Alpine trails above.</p>
<h3>Explore Lake Bohinj: let us count the ways</h3>
<p>Fancy heading out onto the water? Wooden boats cruise Lake Bohinj, panoramic windows framing the forests and mountains all around. Paddleboards are also a popular choice, dedicated bathing areas invite swimmers into the emerald-green waters, and cycling, canyoning and paragliding are all up for grabs too. Just make sure to try one of the local delicacies, such as Bohinjski sir cheese or the shandy-like grapefruit lager brewed in Ljubljana – always best enjoyed with a lake view.</p>
<h3>Bohinjska Bistrica Village</h3>
<p>Many visitors stay in Bohinjska Bistrica – a rural village seven kilometres from Bohinj, with a museum, restaurants, a church and a crystal-clear river running through it. The train station is a motorail that carries vehicles and passengers to Lake Bled or to the modernist town of Nova Gorica, right against the Italian border – but not before plunging through the mountains via the longest railway tunnel in Slovenia first. Above Bohinjska Bistrica, the Pokljuka Plateau is a popular starting point for walks, with dense forests and pretty alpine meadows, plus the idyllic Planina Zajamniki Mountain Pasture with its traditional wooden houses and views for miles.</p>
<h3>Visit Lake Bled</h3>
<p>The Insta-famous vistas of Lake Bled are just a 20-minute train journey or 40-minute bus ride away from Lake Bohinj. This is the Slovenia of postcards and guidebooks the world over, where a church-topped island perches in the middle of a forest-fringed lake. Here, gondola-like pletna boats continue their centuries-old tradition of ferrying visitors between Bled town and the island. It’s easy to spend a day here, hiking or cycling the lakeside paths, diving into the family-friendly lido and summer toboggan, and wining and dining in Bled town – all while the fairy-tale fortifications of Bled Castle look on.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Bohinj has a great network of public transport and lifts that make getting around the area really easy. There are nine organised transport lines that operate around Bohinj between June and September.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>The Vogel cable car takes you from Ukanc up to 1,534 metres above sea level, perfect for high-mountain treks, with both short and long routes to choose from.</p>
<p>From the top of here you can take the Orlove Glave quad chair lift and the Zadnji Vogel Circular Cabin cable car to higher points to unlock even more walking trails.</p>
<p>The Julian Alps Bohinj Guest Card qualifies you for 20% discount on a return ticket for the cable car to Mount Vogel.</p>
<p>The summer operation of the new Zadnji Vogel Cable Car is subject to change.</p>
<h3>Trains</h3>
<p>The Bohinj railway line goes from Bohinjska Bistrica, the main village centre. You can use this service to reach Jesenice and Nova Gorica – taking you in both Northern and Southern directions of the lake itself.</p>
<p>Bikes can be taken onboard this service too, so a great alternative for cycling beyond the resort itself.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>The Pokljuka bus transports you from Bohinj to the high karst plateau of Pokljuka, the largest forested area in the Triglav National Park. This is an excellent starting point to explore walking routes of all types, as well as themed trails like the Goreljek Peat-Bog Nature trail. This bus runs during high-season only.</p>
<p>Use your included Julian Alps Bohinj Guest Card to receive 50% discount on bus tickets to the capital city, Ljubljana. This is one of the most sustainable service options for reaching the city, with daily departures into the Ljubljana’s main bus station.</p>
<p>To get to Lake Bled, the bus journey takes around 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Timetables, free shuttles, and organised transport lines can be found online via the Bohinj Tourist Office website.</p>
<h3>Boats</h3>
<p>The two electric boats on Lake Bohinj, called Zlatorog and Triglavska Roža, are perfect for transporting you between the Western and Easten shores.</p>
<p>The ports of Ukanc and Ribčev Laz mean reaching each end of the lake is simple. Take a boat journey one way and walk back the other. Or, complete a round trip with hiking trails and opportunities in between. This service is a great alternative to the bus for getting to the Vogel cable car in Ukanc from your accommodation.</p>
<p>From the end of June until the middle of September, there are around 14 departure times from each port throughout the day, starting from approx. 9:30am, with the last one being at 6:10pm.</p>
<p>Use your included Julian Alps Bohinj Guest Card for one free boat ride during your stay, maximising your stay with this efficient service.</p>
<h3>Taxis</h3>
<p>Bohinj has an excellent taxi service, so in the event you are trying to reach a walking destination inaccessible via public transport – this is a great service to make use of.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Ribcev Laz - Mostnica Gorge - Voje Valley</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 2.5 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the main road through the village of Stara Fužina until you reach the church; take the road before the church, following it round to the left. It then becomes a track which passes the castle Zoisov Grad and brings you to the Devils Bridge, under which yawns a 20m deep gorge. At the other side of the bridge turn right and follow the road along the gorge of the Mostnica river. Follow the track through the forest; at the last, 3rd bridge follows the signs for 'Voje Slap'. After around 20 minutes walk uphill you will reach the road where the Voje mountain hut is and the start of the Voje valley.</p>
<p>At the hut, you can decide of either going back the same way or you can just follow the road down because it is easier to walk. There is also a waterfall at the end of Voje valley which is very picturesque but that would take another hour one way.</p>
<h3>Ribcev Laz - Hotel Zlatorog and Savica Waterfall</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 3.5 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>From the church of St. John the Baptist, follow the path along the north side of the lake. When you come to Zlatorog Hotel cross the Savica river by a wooden bridge and continue along the gravel track passing a collection of alpine chalets (sign posted 'Savica Waterfall 1hr'). When you come to the mountain hut you will have to pay an entrance fee of 2,5 € and from there walk 500 steps up to the waterfall. From Hotel Zlatorog you can catch a bus back to Ribcev Laz or go on a tourist boat or you can walk back.</p>
<h3>Ribcev Laz - Bohinjska Bistrica</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> easy</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 1.5 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>The path takes you along the left bank of the river Sava Bohinjka across the meadows and it is also suitable for bicycles. Start at St John’s church and walk towards Stara Fuzina. After 5 - 10 minutes turn right across the bridge and follow the sign for Bohinjska Bistrica. When you get there you can always catch a bus for the way back. There is a market in Bohinjska Bistrica every Saturday morning where the local farmers sell their products.</p>
<h3>Stara Fuzina - Studor - Srednja Vas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> easy</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 1.5 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very scenic walk through the villages of the Upper Bohinj Valley and you can walk or cycle along the road. In Stara Fuzina you can visit the Museum of alpine dairy farming and in Studor the Oplen House. Studor village is also famous for the wooden hayracks and all the villages have a lot of old houses preserved. In the village Srednja vas, you can stop in a local Restaurant Rupa and try some typical Slovenian dishes</p>
<p>In Srednja vas you can decide of either going back the same way or go further along the road to Bohinjska Cesnjica and across to Bohinjska Bistrica where you can catch the bus back or go across the ski area Senozete to Savica village and come back to Ribcev Laz.  Museums and Restaurant are closed on Mondays.</p>
<h3>Stara Fuzina - Pec - Rudnica</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate - difficult</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 1.5 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>You can start at St John’s church and walk towards the village of Stara Fuzina. After 5 - 10 minutes turn right across the bridge and follow the sign for Rudnica. The path for Pec branches of after 20 minutes walking up and you can enjoy the views of the lake already from there. It will take you another hour if you would like to continue to Rudnica.</p>
<p>You can enjoy some spectacular views of the valley and the lake from the top. There are different ways of going down but they are rather steep so it would be best to go down the same way. The walk is difficult because of uphill walking.</p>
<h3>Ribcev Laz - Uskovnica Valley</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate - difficult</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 3 hours one way</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the main road through the village of Stara Fužina until you reach the church; take the road before the church, following it round to the left. It then becomes a track which passes the castle Zoisov Grad and brings you to the Devils Bridge. The path and sign for Uskovnica is on the right side of the bridge. The path takes you a bit steeper uphill for about 1 – 1,5 hours through the shady forest and when you come to Planina Blatca joins the road further up. You can either follow the road or you have signs for shortcuts through the forest.  When you come to the hut in Uskovnica you can either take a path down to Voje valley or you come back the same way. There is also an option to come down to Srednja vas. Please have a map with you. The walk is difficult because of uphill walking but very scenic.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Escape into nature on a summer holiday to Lake Bohinj, a glacial lake on the edge of the spectacular Triglav National Park]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Make the most of Lake Bohinj</h3>
<p>Lake Bohinj is the largest natural lake in Slovenia, and the surrounding area is packed with things to see and do. In summer, the water temperature can reach 24 degrees, so it's perfect for a swim. Explore by kayak or canoe, or rent a paddleboard and test your balance on the water. There are at least 16 species of fish in the lake too, so it's worth snorkelling to see what goes on beneath the water's surface.  If you prefer to stay dry, take a relaxing boat ride on the lake, and don't forget to try one of the local cheeses, wines from Goriska Brda and other local delicacies.</p>
<h3>Visit Mt. Vogel</h3>
<p>For the best view in Bohinj, you need to take the cable car up to Mount Vogel at 1,530m and enjoy a bird's eye view of the lake. The top of the lift is a great starting point for long hikes if your a keen walker, but it's worth the trip even for a short wander. There's plenty of wild flowers and animals up in this Alpine landscape, and the Vogel information trail provides information on the area. In high season, the four-seater Orlove Glave chair lift takes you even higher into the mountains with ease, and for the adventurous there's mountain bike trails or you can take to the skies in a paraglide.</p>
<h3>Gorges and waterfalls</h3>
<p>In the Mostnica Gorge, crystal clear water flows through the intricate rock formations that have been creatively carved by nature over thousands of years. It's surrounded by nature, and all you can hear is the rushing of water and the sound of the trees.  Hidden in the hills at the far western end of Lake Bohinj, the Savica Waterfall is one of Slovenia's most visited natural attractions, tumbling 78 metres top to bottom. It's glorified in Slovenian folklore as the birthplace of love stories and captivates visitors from all over the world.</p>
<h3>Museums and culture in Bohinj</h3>
<p>Life in the mountains around Bohinj hasn't always been easy, and its cultural heritage is testament to that. Dotted throughout the mountains, traditional shepherd's huts can still be found on the mountain pastures, once an important part of pastoral livestock farming, with milk and dairy products a key part of everyday diets. You can see a traditional Bohinj farmhouse with black kitchen at the Oplen House. or get a glimpse into the life of Bohinj's shepherds at the Alpine Dairy Museum.</p>
<p>There's a rich mountaineering history in Bohinj, and Mt. Triglav (Slovenia's highest peak) was summited long before the likes of Grossglockner, Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn, and even before the creation of any mountaineering associations. </p>
<h3>Tradition on the Pokljuka Plateau</h3>
<p>20 kilometres long and almost 20 kilometres wide, the Pokljuka Plateau is a huge area with a unique karst landscape, shaped by the Pokljuka glacier and home to many plants and animals. The tradition of Alpine farming continues on the Poklljuka Plateau in summer with shepherds spending their summers here living in traditional wooden sheds. You can buy home-made milk and cheese, and experience a bit of life as it used to be.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
