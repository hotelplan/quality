  <description><![CDATA[<p>Oberau lies right in the heart of the <a data-udi="umb://document/a3049c884df540b8b25693ee1bd46cdd" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a3049c884df540b8b25693ee1bd46cdd}" title="The Wildschonau Valley">Wildschönau</a> valley, a region named for its wild beauty. Whoever came up with that moniker certainly wasn’t exaggerating and Oberau is certainly the ideal spot for a summer holiday in the mountains. This is a postcard-perfect picture of rolling hills and not-too-distant peaks – a promise to hikers who prefer more challenging trails. Walkers and cyclists aren’t the only people exploring the valley. Buses dip between the villages, including Niederau and Auffach, which have cable cars that extend explorations to the rugged mountaintops of the Kitzbühel Alps.</p>
<h3>Holidays in the Wildschönau Valley</h3>
<p>The Wildschönau valley makes accessing all those spectacular views easy. There are half-hour strolls along the sculpture-spotted St Francis’ Path to Niederau village and family-friendly riverside rambles along the dramatic Kundl Gorge. Adventurous hikers, don’t fear; you haven’t packed your poles for nothing. Summer lifts in the neighbouring villages of Niederau and Auffach open up longer paths to peaks. Clamber up to Gratlspitze, which has swapped a silver mining past for its status as one of the best sunset spots in the Wildschönau.</p>
<h3>Enjoying life in the rural lane</h3>
<p>Oberau rests between mountain pastures and wildflower meadows. It’s pretty much a one-road village, with a couple of lanes leading to bakeries and restaurants. The z’Bach Mountain Farm Museum offers some great insights into life in the Wildschönau – an easy stroll along the St. Frances Path. Looking for Wildschönau Cathedral? That’s the nickname for the grand baroque church of St Margaret’s; stick your head in to admire the painted ceilings and glittering altar.</p>
<h3>Mountain hut welcomes</h3>
<p>Wooden mountain huts dot the trails of the Wildschönau – and they’re all ready to welcome weary walkers. Achentalalm, which perches on the path between Oberau and Kragenjoch, is a local favourite, serving weekly specials like schmalznudeln doughnuts. Wherever you go, you’ll encounter a warm Tyrolean welcome and farm-fresh food… as well as the chance to try the heady Wildschönauer Krautinger schnapps, which is only made in the valley thanks to a 300-year-old royal decree.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Oberau: pools, peaks and parks</h3>
<p>The open-air pool and slides of Mountain Pool Wildschönau sit on a scenic path between Oberau and Niederau. There’s room for diving boards, waterslides, playgrounds, gardens and a café – and all with lovely views of forested valley slopes. Drachental Family Park is a must-visit too. The Dragon Flitzer rollercoaster rockets riders down the valley, plus there’s a play lake, tubing track, trampolines, bike tracks, a mini golf course and a 5D cinema – and, of course, a large sun terrace where the grown-ups can observe with an ice cream in hand.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Oberau with Inghams?</h2>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of the Wildschönau’s best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>
<p>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Oberau include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>]]></description>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Walking, cycling, paragliding, museums and more… For a peaceful patch of the Tyrol, there’s lots to do on a summer holiday in Oberau and the Wildschönau valley]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Oberau</h2>
<h3>Over 300km of marked walking trails</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Wildschönau valley is home to a vast range of marked walking trails and is perfect for Nordic walking too. Here you will find plenty of easy to moderate routes, and some longer, more challenging paths and trails can be discovered too.</span></p>
<h3>Cycling and e-biking</h3>
<p>Get a workout on with a mountain bike ride in the valley, or ease your way through the alpine pastures with the help of an electric bike. If you're up for a challenge, power your way along the two-valley circular tour from Oberau, over the Schatzberg mountain to Alpbach valley using the Schatzberg lift, covering a grand total of 36 kilometres.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
<p>Use your Wildschönau card for free access to one of the three tennis courts (bookable locally in advance). Challenge your family or friends to a rally alongside the beautiful backdrop, with a coffee and cake reward at the end in the tennis café.</p>
<h3>Herbs and spice garden</h3>
<p>Make your way to the Salcherhof Farm, where Birgit Haas has created a spectacular 700 square metre herb garden above Auffach village. Here you will discover over 30 different herbs, with a small shop so you can purchase your very own, a lovely Austrian souvenir.</p>
<h3>Silver mine</h3>
<p>The silver mine near the village of Thierbach, showcases the Wildschönau's mining history with galleries and exhibitions of mining methods and insights into the strenuous lives of the miners. Included in your Wildschönau card, you can delve deeper into the traditional valley industry - watch the “Gems from Tirol’s mountains” show to see how important mining has been throughout the Tyrol region.</p>
<h3>Kundl Gorge</h3>
<p>Local legend says the Kundl Gorge was created by the teeth of a huge dragon - discover the clear waters and interesting rock formations of one of Austria's most beautiful gorges that connects the Wildschönau and Inn valleys. The 6.5-kilometre path meanders over bridges and easy-going gravel paths, with spots to rest along the way.</p>
<h3>The Markbachjoch gondola</h3>
<p>You could climb the 1,000-plus metres from Niederau village to the Markbachjoch mountain ridge… or you could jump aboard the gondola that takes you straight to the trails and huts up top. Here, walkers and cyclists weave between tiny chapels, lakeside sculptures and mountain huts, with the peaks of Feldalphorn and Rosskopf always in view. Keep an eye out for eagles above and marmots below… or perhaps that’s not an eagle - paragliders at the Wildschönau flying school also love to launch themselves from the plateaus here.</p>
<h3>Sculpture Park</h3>
<p>Located at the Mittermoosen reservoir are 30 modern art sculptures crafted by the metal artist Josef Feller. Easily accessible via the Markbachjoch cable car, you can unlock a world of picturesque photo spots and a beautiful panorama of the valley below. The mountain reflection on the reservoir water is truly breath-taking.</p>
<h3>Farm to fork feasts</h3>
<p>The farmers of Oberau have grazed their cows in the Wildschönau valley for centuries, bringing with them the soothing soundtrack of cowbells – and some delicious cuisine. Follow footpaths to dairy farms to stock up on herby krauter-schnitt cheese. Some farms also produce a heady schnapps called krautinger – a digestif and traditional cure-all distilled from white beets and made exclusively in this valley since the 18th century. To learn more about farming in this neck of the woods, take the St. Frances Path to the z’Bach Mountain Farm Museum to see how people eked out a living here in the 18th Century.</p>
<p>Standing since 1795, the Farming Museum has a mix of rooms and buildings displaying over 1,200 exhibits of the old Tirolean mountain farmers. On Thursdays from June to September, the museum really comes to life with the craft fair. You can watch live woodcarvers, basket weavers and flax spinners show off their traditional skills</p>
<h3>Cheesemaking farm</h3>
<p>Are you a cheese lover? Take a visit to the nearby village of Niederau for a tour of the fine cheeses from the high pastures. This is a fantastic insight into the production of one of Austria's most famous delicacies.</p>
<h3>Brass band concerts</h3>
<p>Being part of the Wildschönau valley, known locally as the valley of music, Oberau hosts its own brass band concert in the village centre from mid-June onwards. With over 50 men and women playing the atmosphere is incredible and it's a great opportunity to try some local Krautinger schnapps.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful. There are a few sports shops in the village for last minute hiking purchases, however we would advise to be prepared before you travel.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map number 41, which has a scale of 1:30,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Oberau</h3>
<p>Oberau is wonderful area for walkers with over 300 kilometres of marked hiking paths, from rambles through meadows and hillsides up to higher peaks and trails accessed by gondola. There is even the stunning Kundl Gorge which offers gentle and mostly shaded walking among stunning scenery. There are plenty of mountain alms dotted around the walks, including the ‘Käsealm’ above Niederau for fresh milk and cheese. For more adventurous walkers there are also longer trails and peaks to climb.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The Tourist Office runs a fantastic programme of five free guided walks each week, which are very popular and bookable directly with themselves.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
