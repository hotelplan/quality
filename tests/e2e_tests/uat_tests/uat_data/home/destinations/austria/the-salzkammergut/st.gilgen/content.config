  <description><![CDATA[<p>Walking holidays to St. Gilgen take you to the lovely north-western shores of Lake Wolfgang. The wealthy have long sought out its shores, building grand mansions along the waterfront - most famously, Mozart’s family lived here. Other worthwhile explorations include the lakeside path leading past beaches and bays and the Schafberg mountain, which can be reached by Austria’s oldest cog steam railway from <a data-udi="umb://document/0fa258c1078147e4be5f442c15be3088" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0fa258c1078147e4be5f442c15be3088}" title="St. Wolfgang">St. Wolfgang</a>.</p>
<h3>St. Gilgen: hometown of the Mozarts</h3>
<p>St. Gilgen is filled with fanciful baroque and rococo architecture. Cafés, shops and alpine-style houses are adorned with frescoes and oversized flowering balconies, and streets lead to the towering onion-domed church where Mozart’s parents got married. St. Gilgen was the birthplace of Anna Maria, the mother of Mozart, who also had a sister called Nannerl, who was a child prodigy and harpsichordist who often headlined above her famous brother – a career quickly put to and end when she became old enough to marry.</p>
<h3>Salzburg</h3>
<p>To find out more about Nannerl’s brother, head to Salzburg, where museums and operas explore Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s life and works - his birthplace is on the famous Getreidegasse shopping street in the centre of the Old Town. The Salzburg Museum showcases everything from archaeological finds to modern art installations over several grand floors. And, make sure to stroll the Mirabell Gardens or walk up to the Hohensalzburg Fortress which watches over the cobbled streets of the city below. It’s all an hour’s bus journey away from St. Gilgen.</p>
<h3>Into the mountains</h3>
<p>A cable car glides from St. Gilgen to the top of the Zwölferhorn in 10 minutes where panoramic hiking trails lead in all directions and include a family-friendly mountaintop circuit that meanders past sundials, star charts and telescopes that offer intriguing insights into the geology of this corner of the Alps. The Schafberg mountain is another great pick – best reached via the historic cog railway from St. Wolfgang that takes the ache out of the uphill climb - the views from up here are quite something, and there's plenty of exploring to be done on foot.</p>
<h3>Life on Lake Wolfgang</h3>
<p>Two other villages decorate the shores of Lake Wolfgang. St. Wolfgang is home to a myth-wreathed pilgrimage church and footpaths that lead up into the hills behind. Strobl, meanwhile, is the place to chase the sunset. Walk between them by following the waterside paths or hop aboard the historic paddle steamer or one of the ferries that cruise the waters. Water sports are popular too, including paddle-boarding, kayaking, water skiing, sailing and wakeboarding on the blue-green alpine lake - take a dip or rent a rowing boat or pedalo.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in St. Gilgen</h2>
<h3>Lido with pedalo hire</h3>
<p>Let the kids splash around in the shallow beach waters of the St. Gilgen Bay. Lay back on the decking catching some rays, or set up base on the lawn area under an umbrella for shade. Children love the lido area with jumping pier, sandy areas and most importantly, the onsite restaurant to grab an ice cream.</p>
<h3>Family cycling</h3>
<p>Take the kids on a mini bike-ride by the lakeside, or across some of the many flatter fields around the lake.</p>
<h3>Mini golf</h3>
<p>Putt away at the mini adventure golf Gisa Leitgeb, where the whole family can get competitive as you make your way around the course. Who will be crowned the golfing champion?</p>
<h3>Summer toboggan in Strobl</h3>
<p>Travel down the western side of the lake to Strobl, where you can whizz down the metal summer toboggan run. You have not only one, but two runs to choose from, both at a lengthy 1.3 kilometres each – twice the fun.</p>
<h3>Playgrounds around the lake</h3>
<p>All around Lake Wolfgang you will find hidden gems and fantastic parks for the children to run wild in. One of the biggest parks, located at the other end of the lake to St. Gilgen is the leisure park St. Wolfgang, full of slides, climbing frames, outdoor volleyball courts, tunnels and even a smaller children’s area too.</p>
<h3>Abarena Theme Park</h3>
<p>Fantastic for all weathers, children will have a blast and a day full of adventure. They can bounce on the giant air cushion, paddle in the water playgrounds and get into character inside the themed buildings. Or, if they are brave enough, they can face the giant tube slide, spiralling down from 14 metres high.</p>]]></festivals>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>St. Gilgen to Fürberg</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Expect to take around one to two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the prettiest sections around the lake is from St. Gilgen to Fürberg, with a lovely inlet and restaurant in Fürberg to reward yourself with as well. Walk up to Winkl from here for the Hüttenstein Castle and the Gut Aich monastery to incorportae some culture. You can then either walk back, or catch the ferry back to St. Gilgen.</p>
<h3>Zwölferhorn and Illingerberg circuit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>10.6km</li>
<li>Expect to take around four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Pass through wide flower meadows and small wooded areas as you complete this scenic circular route. When you reach the top of the mountain make sure to take a picture of the turquoise waters below. Keep an eye out for the cattle too, they love to graze in some of the areas you’ll walk through.</p>
<h3>St. Wolfgang to the Schafberg</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging walk</li>
<li>13.5km</li>
<li>Expect to take all day (there's no water stops on route so take plenty with you)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the boat to St. Wolfgang where the ascent starts to the summit of Schafberg. During this hike you will be tested with steep inclines and rocky paths, but it's worth it with rewarding views of the three lakes Wolfgangsee, Attersee and Mondsee. At the top, treat yourself to drinks and snacks on the sun terrace before catching Austria's steepest cog railway back down to St. Wolfgang.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in St. Gilgen</h2>
<h3>Getting around</h3>
<p>The pretty lakeside promenade is ideal for gentle walks and fantastic views across to the Schafberg mountain railway, while <a data-udi="umb://document/0fa258c1078147e4be5f442c15be3088" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0fa258c1078147e4be5f442c15be3088}" title="St. Wolfgang">St. Wolfgang</a> is only a boat ride away. There are spectacular views from the top of the Zwölferhorn cable-car and walkers will enjoy the panorama path around the top.</p>
<h3>Steamboat and ferry trips</h3>
<p>All aboard the paddle steamers and ferries of Lake Wolfgang. With six vessels and various routes, you can hop on and off at one of the seven docks to explore the surrounding villages and towns. You can sail all the way down to Strobl in just over one hour, where the largest boat on the lake holds 365 passengers.</p>
<h3>Watersports and surfing</h3>
<p>Spend a day on the water and get involved with a range of watersports on the lake. Looking for a gentle experience, then hire a stand-up paddle board. Looking for something more thrilling? Then you can try sailing, wind surfing and even water skiing.</p>
<h3>Bathing in the lake</h3>
<p>Lake Wolfgang is the perfect place to swim, paddle or relax on the shores. The clear water with 20-degree-celsius temperatures is home to a range of fish, so why not put some goggles and a snorkel on and see what you can spot.</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>There are a few heritage museums in the local area, great for history lovers. The musical instrument museum takes you on a journey around the world, housing approximately 6,000 instruments – some of which are used in a performance too.</p>
<h3>Cycling and mountain biking</h3>
<p>Take a leisurely circular ride along the lake to enjoy the views. If you're looking for looking for more of a challenge, then the Schafberg mountain tour takes you via the little Lake Schwarzensee, covering 47.3 kilometres of trail.</p>
<h3>18-hole golf courses</h3>
<p>There are 11 golf courses located within close proximity to St. Gilgen. Why not spend a day on the nearby lake of Mondsee where you'll find one of Austrias most outstanding golf courses. With stunning blue waters in contrast with the bright green lawn, you can pitch and putt, with a break at the end in the clubhouse as a reward.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
<p>St. Gilgen has four tennis courts for you to enjoy. Maybe you are practising the technique of your swing, or you are an avid tennis play. The tennis courts here have you covered, all whilst surrounded by the beautiful mountains within the Salzkammergut region.</p>
<h3>Events and music</h3>
<p>In St. Gilgen there's an open-air music pavilion in the village centre which hosts regular classical, folklore and brass band concerts. The annual village ‘Dorf Fest’ (around 15 Jun) is the biggest festival of the year with traditional live entertainment, music, beer tents and food stalls.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>We recommend Kompass Map number 018, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we love walking holidays in St. Gilgen</h3>
<p>St. Gilgen and Lake Wolfgang offer over 120 kilometres of marked walking trails, over rolling hills and rural pastures, through woodland and up to high peaks with stunning lake panoramas. There are easy lakeside paths and panoramic walks from the top of the lift stations, as well as challenging hikes up to local peaks and various marked trails back down the mountains for those who don’t want to climb. St. Wolfgang and Fuschl are easily accessed by ferry or bus.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
