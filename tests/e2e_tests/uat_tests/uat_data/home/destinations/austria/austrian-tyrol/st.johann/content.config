There are plenty of shops and restaurants - guests enjoy the ‘Huber Bräu’ local Brewery with its very own tower, for traditional cuisine and views. The town is surrounded by miles of gentle walking and cycling paths, including riverside and valley walks to Kitzbühel, as well as more challenging routes up to higher peaks - some accessible by gondola.

  <tagline><![CDATA[A summer holiday in St. Johann in Tirol combines a lively and authentic Austrian atmosphere with fantastic walking opportunities in the Wilder Kaiser and Kitzbüheler Alps ]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in St. Johann in Tirol</h2>
<h3>An authentic Austrian town</h3>
<p>Stroll past traditional Austrian buildings, painted in light colours and intricate decorative murals. With a central square and open spaces to enjoy a break, St. Johann can be both a lively and peaceful atmosphere. It's particularly lovely when the Wednesday village evening brings the town to life, or when the locals embrace a festival.</p>
<h3>Harschbichl cable-car</h3>
<p>Ascending nearly 1,000 metres, the cable car quickly whisks you up the mountain ready for a world of adventures. Breaking the journey up, the mid-station is not to be passed by without a visit to the Hornpark climbing world, or Harschbichl Trail, fantastic for eager mountain bikers. For a thrilling experience, hire a mountain cart to make the decent more fun.</p>
<h3>Explore the routes of the region</h3>
<p>Walk, run or cycle your way through forest routes or open spaces at your own pace. With around 200 kilometres of marked walking paths and cycling trails, you can take it as slow or fast as you please - hire an e-bike for a helping hand on those steep inclines.</p>
<h3>Swimming lake</h3>
<p>Cool off in the St. Johann outdoor pool or head to the Badesee bathing lake at nearby Going – surrounded by beautiful scenery, and extremely refreshing on a hot summers' day. Fresh water is supplied to the man-made lake, complimenting the clean mountain air that surrounds you. Relax on the spacious lawn to recharge for another day of mountain fitness - these spots are great for kids too.</p>
<h3>Local train station</h3>
<p>The St. Johann train station offers easy connections for exploring further afield - it's just 10 minutes or so to Kitzbühel, or stay on to explore cities like Innsbruck or Kufstein. The fortress in Kufstein is worth a visit, but the hidden gem of the town has to be the single-person chair lift that rises up the back of the Wilder Kaiser mountains where the views are spectacular.</p>
<h3>Visit Salzburg</h3>
<p>Salzburg is is a hub of music and culture, famed as the filming location for many scenes in the "Sound of Music" and it's the birthplace of Mozart. The Mirabel Palace and Gardens are a spectacle at any time of the year, and it's easy to lose yourself wandering the pretty streets of the Old Town - take a look in Mozart's birthplace, a boat trip on the river, or a walk up to the Hohensalzburg Fortress.</p>
<h3>Heritage museum</h3>
<p>Two connected buildings in the heart of St. Johann are home to the local museum and gallery, ideal for keen exhibition enthusiasts. At a very low admission fee, this is the perfect activity to squeeze into one of those days where you want to take it slow.</p>
<h3>Evening entertainment</h3>
<p>On Wednesdays, St. Johann hosts the “Lang &amp; Klang” (from early July to September). Turning the village centre into a show stage, adults can tune into the live music, night-time shop or indulge in some treats in the restaurants, bars, or gardens.</p>
<h3>Festivals &amp; events</h3>
<p>Regular annual festivals and events bring St. Johann to life throughout the summer with live music, beer tents, food stalls and entertainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly farmers’ market in Town square</li>
<li>Brass band concerts in Town square</li>
<li>Excellent weekly Tyrolean evening (pay locally)</li>
<li>Vintage car rally in Kitzbühel (early Jun)</li>
<li>Billy goat mountain top festival (mid Jul)</li>
<li>Summer Solstice bonfire night (mid Jun)</li>
<li>Jaggas’n town fair (mid Jul)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hot-air balloon rides</h3>
<p>Soar over the Kitzbüheler Alps and on a magical hot-air balloon experience. There's no better way to see the region below than from an open-top basket - especially at sunset.</p>
<h3>Segway tours</h3>
<p>Put your helmet on, it's time for a ride - enjoy the landscape in comfort and style. Hold on tight as you sightsee and explore in an exhilarating and unique way.</p>
<h3>Golf</h3>
<p>Beginner, expert, or keen to get into a new hobby? With the mountains right behind you, the golf courses in Kitzbühel or at Lärchenhof are the ideal place to either unwind or compete. Remember, practice makes perfect, so the driving range is just the place for a course “warm-up.”</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map number 452, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingDescription></walkingDescription>
  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in St. Johann</h3>
<p>St. Johann is set in a wide and beautiful valley between the majestic Wilder Kaiser massif and the Kitzbüheler Horn. There are many additional side valleys to explore and over 200 kilometres of marked hiking paths and nine themed walking trails. St. Johann is also the start of Austria’s famous ‘Eagles Way’ long distance walking trail from East to West Tyrol. Terrain varies from meadow walks and riverside trails to the higher peaks of the Harschbichl gondola and Wilder Kaiser mountains. Excellent bus and train links also make it easy to explore the neighbouring Kitzbühel, Ellmau and Söll walking areas.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>St. Johann Tourist Office runs a free programme of guided walks that changes weekly, plus hiking booklets and stamps for those completing stages of the ‘Eagles Way.’</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
