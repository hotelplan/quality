  <description><![CDATA[<p>Söll is a valley village filled with people who treasure tradition – whether that’s welcoming visitors to its flower-bedecked hotels or celebrating the return of their beloved cows from the high mountain pastures each summer (flower crowns included). Söll’s open green valley rises into the foothills of the vast Wilder Kaiser mountains to the North, and the Bergwelt to the South. In winter, this area is one of Austria’s biggest ski regions. In summer, the pistes transform into over 700 kilometres of walking paths linked by lifts and public transport.</p>
<h3>Tyrolean heights</h3>
<p>Two very different mountains bookend Söll, making for varied adventuring terrain. The jagged dragon’s spine of Wilder Kaiser juts its grey limestone peaks to the north, green mountains roll out to the south, and a valley stretches out between. Lifts climb into the mountains, pausing at peaks and plateaus, before dropping back down into neighbouring valleys and villages. Mountain biking is big around these parts too. Keen pedallers can check out the pump track at Lake Ahornsee on the south side of Söll or venture into the wooded slopes to discover exciting mountain trails around Brixen.</p>
<h3>Hochsöll and Hohe Salve</h3>
<p>One of the most popular – and most accessible – mountain ascents from Söll is the Hohe Salve. First, board the new cable car bound for Hochsöll and the mountain park of Hexenwasser. Here, families can explore pools, stepping stones and barefoot trails while learning about the tales of the valleys around.</p>
<p>A second cable car climbs further still to the peak of the Hohe Salve, where the highest pilgrimage chapel in Austria keeps an eye on the valleys and villages far below. Paragliders are also found up here, ready to launch themselves into the crisp mountain air. You can choose to keep your feet firmly grounded, following footpaths to glassy lakes and mountain huts.</p>
<h3>Soak up the mountain spirit in Söll</h3>
<p>Söll village is full of surprises. Take the parish church – it might look like a classic alpine sanctuary from the outside, but inside it’s a flamboyant rococo concoction of painted ceilings and sacred sculptures. Restaurants and shops are well-stocked with local meat, cheese, ice cream and breads sourced from the farms that freckle the valley. The town band doesn’t need much of an excuse to strike up a Tyrolean tune, either, putting on weekly concerts and village evenings in summer.</p>
<h3>Explore by cable cars, valley buses and trains</h3>
<p>Buses roll along the valleys of the Wilder Kaiser, stopping at picturesque villages such as Scheffau and Ellmau, and at the turquoise waters of Hintersteinersee lake. Where there’s a village, there’s usually a lift – and they’ve all got their own specialties. Some cable cars deliver families to child-friendly walks, others take you to renowned mountain huts, and others are gateways to the wilder paths of the Wilder Kaiser. For a trip to the city, catch the bus to fortress-topped Kufstein. Trains run from the town centre to Innsbruck in the west and Salzburg in the east. There's a mountain lift hidden in Kufstein too, the single person chair-lift that slowly rises up the back of the Wilder Kaiser mountains is a real hidden gem, offering up some incredible views and peaceful surroundings.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Söll</h2>
<h3>Mountain biking</h3>
<p>Biking is increasing in popularity all over Austria and Söll is no exception. There's a new pump track near the Ahornsee Lake where you can practise your skills, plus rental shops in town offering adults and kids bikes. Guided tours are available locally which are a great way to explore the area.</p>
<h3>Hintersteinersee lake</h3>
<p>This picturesque lake is worth a visit, whether you have kids or not. The bathing area has rentals of sunbeds, umbrellas and stand-up paddleboards, and it's very refreshing for a swim in the clear waters. You can walk all the way round the lake - the south side is quite hilly but shaded, and the north side is sunny and flatter, following a quiet road. Three restaurants offer refreshments along the way and a full lap of the lake will take around two to two and a half hours.</p>
<h3>Ahornsee bathing lake</h3>
<p>Enjoy a day of relaxation at the Ahornsee while the kids swim and play - the views from this lake are beautiful and it's easy to find a comfortable spot to settle down in for a few hours. There's a lido area and floating platform which is fun to swim out to. Plus, there's toilets and changing rooms, and a café with hot food, ice cream and drinks.</p>
<p>The Badesee bathing lake near the town of Going is also worth a visit with the family. This lake has lots going on for children including water slides and play areas. It's accessible using the free Kaiserjet Bus from Söll.</p>
<h3>Kaiserbad Ellmau</h3>
<p>The Kaiserbad swimming pool is a must-visit on a sunny day if you have energetic kids - there's an extensive outdoor pool area, water slides and a big play area. It's also a great wet weather option, as it has a large indoor area with water slides, whirlpool, swimming area and loungers. Within the complex, there's also an indoor climbing wall separate to the swimming area.</p>
<h3>Fun family walks</h3>
<p>There are plenty of walking options around the Söll area that will appeal to children as well as adults. From Hexenwasser adventure play area, the walk to Filmzalmsee Lake has a hut stop on route, and the play areas around the lake are lots of fun. For the best views, head to the top of Scheffau's Brandstadl lift and follow Panorama trail to the top of the Ellmau Hartkaiser lift. On the way you'll pass various adventure parks and have panoramic views the whole way - there's plenty of places for food with a view too.</p>
<h3>Hexenwasser and the Hohe Salve</h3>
<p>The Hexenwasser (Witches' Water) on the Hohe Salve mountain in Söll is paradise for children. There's lots of activities for children to get involved with, adventure play areas, and Austria's longest barefoot walk which is enjoyed by children and adults alike. Maybe you'll even get to meet the Witches as you explore, too.</p>
<h3>KaiserWelt Scheffau</h3>
<p>At the top of Scheffau's Brandstadl lift is the KaiserWelt, which means Emperor's World. Children can play in the playground and the various wooden tree huts while parents admire the view of the Wilder Kaiser mountains on the other side of the valley. Take a walk to the Jochstub'n Lake - a unique high mountain lake with little sailing boat.</p>
<h3>Ellmi's Zauberwelt Ellmau</h3>
<p>This is the land of fantasy and magic - there's lots to discover at the top of Ellmau's Hartkaiserbahn lift. As well as the enchanted forest, there's a large adventure playground with water area, zip line, trampoline and much more to delight younger children.</p>]]></festivals>

<h3>Explore the village and valley</h3>
<p>In Söll there is a good selection of cafés, shops and restaurants for you to explore and try out. With pretty buildings and a standout church, taking a stroll around the village is very peaceful. Or, hop on the free valley bus and go on an adventure to see what's around.</p>
<h3>Ahornsee bathing lake in Söll</h3>
<p>Did someone say a dip in the Ahornsee? Perfectly located, you can enjoy a leisurely stroll from your hotel to the lake, ideal for being in the great outdoors as much as possible. Lay back on a deckchair, jump off the diving tower, paddle in the shallow water or swim until your hearts content – all while enjoing the immaculate scenery around you.</p>
<h3>Kaiserbad leisure centre</h3>
<p>Don't forget to pack your bathing suits, you won't want to miss out on the swimming and wellness facilities near the village of Ellmau. There's a large spa with infrared cabins, solarium, saunas and steam baths (but bare in mind, spas are often nude zones in Austria). Or, stretch and strengthen your body with a swim – there is an indoor and outdoor pools, water slides plus a natural swimming pond too.</p>
<p>If the weather takes a turn, there's also great sprots facilities here, including tennis and squash courts and an indoor climbing hall.</p>

<h3>Visit to Kufstein</h3>
<p>Just north of Söll and about 25 minutes on the bus you will find the medieval masterpiece of Kufstein Fortress and its open-air arena. Located on top of the hill, the views are stunning. Here you’ll find a museum, funicular train and amazing photo-spots looking over the Inn River which runs all the way from Switzerland, through Austria and to Germany.</p>
<p>Kufstein also has a good variety of shops, restaurants and pretty streets, but its best feature has to be the single person chairlift which rises up the back of the Wilder Kaiser mountains, offering a peaceful and easy ascent matched with incredible views.</p>
<h3>Sporting facilities</h3>
<p>With excellent transport links, you can easily access destinations that are home to many different sports. Maybe you are looking for a game of tennis? Then the three clay courts at the Franzlhof have you covered – there is even a small pit-pat course and crazy golf too, so perfect for the whole family. </p>
<h3>Golf in Ellmau</h3>
<p>Are you ready for a day of golfing bliss? Pop on the quick bus ride to the nearby resort of Ellmau, home to a mighty 27 holes, spread across three 9-hole courses. With the sun shining and the Wilder Kaiser watching, you are in for a treat. Rent your golf clubs and take to the greens – it's time to get started.</p>
<h3>Festivals and events</h3>
<p>In and around Söll there are several festivals and events, with lots being in the village itself. Often you will find the open-air brass band concert in full swing, played by the locals and various village evenings bring the centre alive arts, crafts, local food and drink or live music.

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map number 451, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Söll</h3>
<p>The village of Söll forms part of the massive Wilder Kaiser - Brixental area which has a network of over 700 kilometres of walking paths. It is a beautiful valley, with endless walking opportunities all linked by a superb network of lifts. There are plenty of scenic hiking routes and family trails to discover, with one of the most beautiful mountain ranges - the Wilder Kaiser - right on your doorstep. Explore the rocky paths and rugged peaks, so stay on the south side of the valley for the great lift network and easily accessible trails - Söll has plenty for everyone.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>Söll <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.wilderkaiser.info/en/events/list-events.html" target="_blank">Tourist Office</a> offers regular guided walks and good maps of the local area. The walks may need to be booked in advance, directly with the tourist office.</p>
