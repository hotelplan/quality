  <description><![CDATA[<p>Après ski makes way for a somewhat quieter pace in Ischgl in the summer months. High in the sunny, green valley of Paznaun, and surrounded by mountains, this former farming village now manages to combine sporty style and a touch of luxury with traditional charm. Spend your days exploring the many rugged trails or take a cable car over the mountains to Switzerland for lunch. Stroll along riverbanks or cool off with a dip in one of many picturesque Alpine lakes. And, as Ischgl loves spa treatments and great food as much as it loves action and adventure, prepare for some self-indulgence and pampering as part of your stay.</p>
<h3>From hikes and bikes to high-flying adventure</h3>
<p>What do you fancy - rocky mountain hikes, Nordic walking or thrilling bike rides? Head off along the old smugglers trail up to the Viderjoch ridge and along the Swiss border or walk a section of the Paznaun High Trail. There's something for everyone, with over 300 kilometres of marked walking trails, 1,000 kilometres of bike trails and you’ve also got access to lifts throughout the valley and into Switzerland.</p>
<p>For something different, try the Skyfly zipwire over the Kitzloch ravine, take to the sky in a paraglider, or head down river in a kayak or canoe.</p>
<h3>Discover Ischgl</h3>
<p>There are a handful of pretty boutiques in the town if you fancy a bit of shopping and you can’t miss the distinctive architecture of the exclusive Silvretta Therme Spa. A dip in their panoramic outdoor pool after a wellbeing massage is a must. The mountain lake of Madleinsee is popular with nature lovers, while the Pardatschersee lake is great for families and adventure lovers, with play areas, adventure trails and suspension bridges to discover. </p>
<p>Just outside Ischgl, at Vidersee Lake, the kids will love the Vider Truja Adventure Park which is a water-themed park with fountains and waterfalls, and a Barefoot Trail. It’s a 7.5 km walk but you can catch a gondola if you prefer.</p>
<h3>Exploring the area</h3>
<p>Pack a picnic and hike to the emerald green waters of Lake Berglisee for the day. The water is revitalising and there are grill stations lakeside for your picnic. A little further down the valley from Ischgl, the old villages of See and Kappl are both worth a visit. See has a shallow swimming lake which is great for the kids and you can hire parasols and deckchairs. Kappl has its own waterpark, and the many little cafés in the main street are a perfect place to stop for a Schnapps before you head back to Ischgl.</p>
<h3>Destination foodie</h3>
<p>Ischgl has become a bit of a foodie hotspot with some award-winning restaurants where you can tuck into Austrian specialities like their traditional Ischgler Käsespätzle or sweet pancake desserts. You’ll find some of the best restaurants are in the hotels like The Stüva at Hotel YSCLA (you can’t miss the stunning exterior) recently voted one of the six best restaurants in Austria.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Ischgl</h2>
<h3>Vider Truja</h3>
<p>Located at 2320 metres altitude, a short walk from the Silvrettabahn A1 or Fimbabahn A3 lifts, the Vider Truja adventure park is full of exciting things for the children. From bouldering towers for older children, to trim-trails and trampolines for the younger ones. This recreational ground covers a large area, amazing for children to run around while parents get comfy and supervise from one of the wooden loungers.</p>
<h3>Ischgl Skyfly</h3>
<p>Zoom down the two-kilometre mountain zipline at 85 kilometres an hour. Fly through the valley together as you race your friends or family. Three minutes of flying at 50 metres above the ground will definitely be something the children remember. It's open Tuesday to Sunday and you can use your included Silvretta Premium Card to get a discounted rate on this wild adventure.</p>
<h3>Adventure Stage</h3>
<p>If you have younger children, head to the adventure stage at the Lake Schwarzwasser and Lake Pardatschersee which has stone, wood and rope installations along beautiful nature trails. Wander through the forest and along the lake shores, experiencing constant action and highlights for the kids to burn some energy. Climb, balance, slide and jump your way through the interactive obstacles along the way to add an exciting element to your walk.</p>
<h3>Swimming in nature</h3>
<p>Dip your toes in the lake to cool off or take the full plunge and go for a swim. The bathing lake in See, Paznaun-Ischgl, is surrounded purely by nature and a range of senses for the younger ones to explore. From jumping piers to rocky beach areas, this natural leisure area is full of fun for the whole family. You can even lay back on the grass edge as the children keep themselves amused in the park by the shallow kids pond too.</p>
<h3>Family sports</h3>
<p>With 18 holes the mini-golf in Ischgl is a great hit for families with younger children. Located in Trisannaweg you can take a leisurely stroll from the village centre. Grab an ice cream from the kiosk to celebrate the winner at the end. You can also find beach volleyball and trampolines at this active centre too, great for children and adults alike.</p>
<h3>Playground Sandli</h3>
<p>Embrace yourself in the natural water playground as part of a circular hiking route. Stride across the wooden bridges, take your boots off and splash in the water stream, or simply relax with the beautiful panorama of Ischgl. This easy-to-get-to family adventure is a great combination of refreshing natural water and energy burning routes to keep the little ones entertained.</p>]]></festivals>
