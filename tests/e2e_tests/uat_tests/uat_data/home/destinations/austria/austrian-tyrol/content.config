  <description><![CDATA[<p>It is hard not to fall under the spell of the mountain villages in the Austrian Tyrol. The picturesque wooden chalets laden by snow in the winter, transform into a feast of colour during the summer. Almost every balcony is taken over by geraniums. Window boxes filled to bursting adorn every café, hotel or restaurant, while wildflowers cover the undulating verdant green pastures. This scenery filled with streams, gushing waterfalls and glacial lakes against the backdrop of the <a data-udi="umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760}" title="Austria">Austrian</a> Alps makes you want to enjoy the outside immediately. <span>In summer it offers fantastic hiking paths and stunning views of lakes and valleys. In addition, Tiroleans love their traditions and food. It’s a great place to get an insight into the Austrian culture.</span></p>
<p>You’ll discover a wide range of activities and also plenty of options for relaxation. </p>
<p>One of the great joys in the small mountain villages of the Tyrol is that most of the hotels and larger chalets are family owned and have been for generations. <a data-udi="umb://document/085c5cbb87794e7c9ca8a69475a257df" href="/{localLink:umb://document/085c5cbb87794e7c9ca8a69475a257df}" title="Soll">Söll</a>, situated between the Wilder Kaiser and Hohe Salve mountains is typical of a resort that combines peace and quiet, stunning views and a wide range of accommodation. Festivals and open-air concerts are plentiful including the legendary <a data-udi="umb://document/fcef0a0163e046fab723993f32992cd8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/fcef0a0163e046fab723993f32992cd8}" title="Almabtrieb">Almabtrieb</a>, a festival held in September to celebrate the cows returning from pastures. Dozens of cows are adorned with lush floral displays and large cowbells and look extremely regal as they parade through the villages.</p>
<p>Austrian weather in mountainous areas can be unpredictable, especially at high altitude, but in the flatter, more gentle terrain and pastureland of the central Austrian Tyrol expect high summer sun. In July and August, average temperatures are around 21º–24º C in the day with mornings and evenings much lower. Sunblock is essential, but layering for evenings when the sun has set is the way to go.</p>]]></description>

<p>Bacon, cheese, cold meats or any kind of dumpling, often served in a clear soup, and served with sauerkraut are just a few Tyrolean staples. Then there are the desserts, Kiachl, a fried yeast dough pastry dusted with sugar and served with cranberry jam inside, Moosbeernocken, wild mountain blueberries in a pancake sprinkled with sugar and strudel varieties native to the region. On the savory side, Tiroler Gröstl is a delicious bacon, onion and potato fry up served with a fried egg on top.</p>
<p>Kasspatzln is a pasta or soft egg noodle with grated cheese and oven-baked with fried onion. A typical starter will be a plate of cold meats, “Marend”, dry-cured and smoked speck (bacon) local cheeses, gherkins and horseradish. And while not strictly speaking from the Tyrol, don’t leave without trying Kaiserschmarrn, a shredded pancake baked in butter and stewed plums, named after Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I. Nearly every village or town has its own local beer or microbrewery and there are many excellent wines. Many of the cozy Tyrolean inns and stubes are award winning restaurants where it is customary to end a meal with a Schnapps, usually offered by your host.</p>
