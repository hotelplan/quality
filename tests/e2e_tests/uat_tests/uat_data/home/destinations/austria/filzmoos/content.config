  <description><![CDATA[<p>Many would be hard-placed to pin Filzmoos on a map – and that’s a good thing. This small village is tucked between the rugged Bischofsmütze and Dachstein mountains and surrounded by alpine meadows, streams, pine forests and mountain lakes. Summer holidays to Filzmoos are all about getting out into nature, with trails from the doorstep and the village has an off-the-beaten-track feel. It's filled with tradition – expect a genuine Austrian welcome, and probably a brass band concert or two. Houses cluster around the village square, church and green, which host open-air concerts and festivals throughout summer.</p>
<h3>Wild walking</h3>
<p>With over 250 kilometres of trails around, there’s something for every type of wanderer, from pram-toting families seeking easy strolls to keen trekkers looking for rugged limestone peaks. That said, Filzmoos best suits active walkers. The Gerzkopf Nature Reserve is a hiking paradise - it was declared a nature reserve in 1981, and offers moors and mountaintops, all with fabulous views of surrounding peaks. The 350-kilometre-long Salzburger Almenweg long-distance trail also passes through Filzmoos. Fancy following in the surefooted steps of an expert? Guided walks regularly start from the tourist office, run by Filzmoos Activ.</p>
<h3>Explore by cable car or tractor taxi</h3>
<p>The Papageno Cable Car whisks passengers up to Rossbrand mountain where you can marvel at the 360-degree views over 150 or so mountain peaks and sip a coffee at the sleekly renovated mountain hut. In a little over an hour, and with not too much height gain (160 metres), you can be at the summit of the Rossbrand mountain - for peak-baggers, this is one of the summits of the Salzburger Summit Game. Meanwhile, the Fidibus walker's bus takes wanderers to alms, towns and trailheads and the Almi shuttle – a wooden trailer hauled on the back of a tractor - runs to and from the Aualm.</p>
<h3>Mountain huts with character</h3>
<p>Charming mountain huts dot the hillsides and pastures around Filzmoos - some of the best include the 350-year-old Oberhofalm, which cooks Alpine specialities like dumplings near the foot of Bischofsmütze mountain – named for its bishop’s hat shape. Nearby Unterhofalm is another great hut, serving brettljaus'n meat and cheese platters and homemade doughnuts in one of the most beautiful pastures in the Alps.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Filzmoos</h3>
<p>A one-hour walk – or speedier shuttle bus ride – takes you to the Bachlalm mountain hut. As well as serving up mountain fare cooked in the original antique oven, the hills around serve as a favourite sunbathing spot for marmots. A family-friendly nature trail can be found here too. Want a break from walking? Head to the leisure centre at Filzmoos, which comes with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a climbing wall and bowling alley. Active youngsters will also love the play area at the top of the Papageno cable car.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family Activities in Filzmoos</h2>
<h3>Family Hiking and themed trails</h3>
<p>Known as the hiking village of Salzburgerland, Filzmoos has an array of themed trails and hiking routes suitable for all family members. If your little ones are up for an adventure, then grab a stamp booklet and head out on the children's trail to the Moosalm – there is even a small reward once completed. Other themed trails include the Ant's path, Wooden Figure Path and the Hofalm or Bachlalm nature trails.</p>
<h3>Mini-golf</h3>
<p>Fun for the whole family, the adventure mini-golf course features 18 holes with an island, bridges and even volcano-themed lanes. Keep track of your scores as you compete as a family – who will be the winner and ultimate crazy-golfing champion?</p>
<h3>Bowling</h3>
<p>Head to the Filzmoos leisure centre for a fun game of bowling. The 2 alleys provide constant entertainment and chance for a head-to-head battle for larger groups.</p>
<h3>Filzmoos Leisure Complex</h3>
<p>Swim or splash around as a family at the indoor and outdoor pool – featuring a kid's version too. Younger children and teens can keep themselves entertained at the playground and fun-court while you can enjoy a relaxing moment on the sunbathing lawn.</p>
<h3>Ice caves at the Dachstein Glacier</h3>
<p>Cross hollow bridges between rock and ice, incredibly displayed from below by an immersive light and sound show. This reconstructed natural wonder is sure to get the children's adrenaline levels rocketed as they brave the 30-metre depth rope bridge. Make sure to listen out for the cave bears on the way.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Filzmoos has a great network of public transport and lift that makes getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h3>Lift</h3>
<p>The Papageno cable car usually opens in the second half of May and transports you from the village centre up to the adventure mountain Rossbrand. From here you can then explore many hiking routes with a range of terrain and fantastic views. This cable car is included in the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.filzmoos.at/en/services/filzmoos-sommer-card.html" target="_blank">Filzmoos Summer Card</a> offered at certain properties, or payable locally for one-way or return tickets on the day.</p>
<p>The lift opening dates for summer 2024 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>From May 21st to June 29th on Tuesdays and Saturdays only</li>
<li>From July 2nd to September 22nd on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays only</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note this lift will be closed in the event of bad weather. The Hotel Alpenkrone doesn't offer the Filzmoos Summer Card so the lift is payable locally.</em></p>
<h3>Buses and shuttles</h3>
<p>The Fidibus operates several routes including to Neuberg, Hofalm, Rettensteinhütte and nearby Ramsau.</p>
<p>The Almi Shuttle is a rustic tractor and trailer shuttle that offers transport form the village to some traditional mountain huts.</p>
<p>The Marmot Express is a shuttle between the village and the Bachlalm via forest road (not in operation on Tuesdays).</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Almsee Lake and Hofalmen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>7.5km</li>
<li>Expect to take around two to three hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk is perfect for a morning stroll, with directions leading right from the village square, meaning no public transport is required. Wind your way through the forest, parallel to the roads, and explore the alpine smells, flowers and fresh air before reaching the mirrored lake – perfectly reflecting the wonderful scenery that surrounds you.</p>
<h3>Rossbrand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>13.7km</li>
<li>Expect to take around five to six hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This spectacular circular walk will reward you with amazing views of the Bischofsmütze mountain and snow covered Dachstein glacier once you reach the summit – you can also get a picture with the giant cross too. This hike is a great alternative to catching the Papageno cable car, with a fulfilling sense of accomplishment. You can also enjoy a schnitzel in one of the huts along the way, but make sure to prepare extra time.</p>
<h3>Filzmoos’ highest peak the Gerzkopf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>11.65km</li>
<li>Expect to take around six hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Hop on the Filzmooser Wanderbus to Neuberg before the ascent starts. You will pass through untouched and pristine landscapes blooming with vibrant yellows and greens. As well as this you’ll venture through the fairytale-like forest before reaching breathtaking 360-degree panoramic views from the Gerzkopf summit. Check out how many surrounding peaks you can spot from here too – including some of the Hohentauern National Park in the far distance.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

<p>Have you been on your feet all day? Visit the Kneipp course for a relaxing way to revitalise and create a sense of calm. You can massage your soles by walking on the gentle or rough paths, stimulate blood circulation by reaching into the cool trough, or simply stand in the water-treading pool as a reward for completing a climb, hike, or mountain cycle.</p>
<h3>Relax at Filzmoos leisure centre</h3>
<p>After a long morning walk, an afternoon of relaxation and rejuvenation at the Filzmoos leisure centre is just the ticket. Take a refreshing dip in the pool, unwind in the whirlpool, or reset your body in the saunas and steam room - ready for another day of adventures tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Sporting activities</h3>
<p>Within an hour transfer you can reach the Salzach river for a ride on the rolling rapids. Hold on tight to your paddle as you are guaranteed to get wet. If you prefer to stay on the ground, test your forearm in a game of tennis in the village or, explore beyond Filzmoos for a wide range of activities on offer in the Salzburgerland Region.</p>
<h3>Cycling in the Bischofsmütze and Dachstein mountain range</h3>
<p>Keen bikers, Filzmoos is calling your name. Covering over 150 kilometres and 12 varied mountain biking routes, the bike village of Filzmoos is a fantastic place to go to this summer. If your looking for an easier route then the Eisstadl family tour is best for you, or for biking enthusiasts with good stamina, take on the Filzmoos Hut Rally, a 17.5 kilometre difficult route that's sure to get your legs burning.</p>
<h3>Farmhouse museum</h3>
<p>Take a visit to one of the oldest buildings in Filzmoos. Open every Tuesday from 4pm, the Oberhof farm museum is full to the brim with old tools and farming equipment that were used year-round. The front of the farmhouse is always beautifully decorated with blooming flowers – making it a great photo spot.</p>
<h3>Visit natural wonders or a 900-year-old fortress</h3>
<p>Have your camera at the ready as you spiral your way down the Liechtenstein Gorge and meander along the rocky paths – with fast streams and beautiful waterfalls coming from all directions. More into your history than geography? Visit the Hohenwerfen castle which stands high above the Salzach valley – not too far from Filzmoos, for a medieval experience.</p>
<h3>Festivals and Events</h3>
<p>Filzmoos comes alive during the summer months (late June to end August) with the village brass band playing regularly in the evenings, and a selection of festivals including the annual Dorf Fest (Village Festival) in July, National dress days, doughnut and dumpling festivals plus many others with food stalls, entertainment, live music and dancing in the village square.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

Walks are graded blue, red and black for difficulty/length and there is often a choice of walks each day. A small local charge may be payable.
