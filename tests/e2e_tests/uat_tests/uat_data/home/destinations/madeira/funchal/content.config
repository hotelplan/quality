  <description><![CDATA[<p>Funchal is a lively, sprawling city – famous for its harbour, mountain backdrop and flower displays. The city’s split into about 10 parishes, all slightly unique, so there’s plenty of nooks and crannies to explore on holiday.</p>
<p>Most hotels are in the São Martinho area, and you should definitely pop to the old town to get a proper feel for the history and culture. The narrow alleyways are always fun for a wander, with lots of lovely cafés and restaurants to stop in when you feel peckish. Take some time to explore the busy harbour, too. We love sitting by the water to watch the world go by.</p>
<h3>Explore Funchal's culture: street art on the doorstep</h3>
<p>Take a stroll down the street of Rua de Santa Maria to see a colourful collection of nearly 200 doors that have been painted by local artists. It was an effort to breathe some life into an area that was previously a little run down – we’re happy to confirm it’s a thriving spot to explore and a must-see on your holiday.</p>
<h3>Funchal's thriving food scene</h3>
<p>Get your hands on some fresh tropical fruit, like bananas and passion fruit, at Mercado dos Lavradores, the local farmer’s market. The ones at home won’t taste the same after you’ve tried these. The market is a magnet for food-lovers as the sights, smells and colours are irresistible – maybe pick up something to bring back?</p>
<p>If wine is what gets you excited, there are a few tasting venues for the full experience, but most local bars will have a selection of Madeiran wines to try. The sweet, rich taste makes it very distinctive – you can’t leave without giving it a go.</p>
<p>You won’t be short of restaurants either. Funchal has a great foodie scene including a surprising amount of fine dining options and Michelin recommendations. Try a bolo do caco – a bread dish you’ll find most places, usually smothered in garlic butter and optionally topped with seafood like octopus or made into a sandwich.</p>
<h3>The full Monte</h3>
<p>To get a different view of the city, jump on the cable car to Monte and head for the Botanical Gardens, they're particularly beautiful in the summer. You’ll get great views across the bay before heading into the gardens for an explosion of colour and design.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get around Funchal, you can walk but it’s hilly in places so if you’re not up to the challenge there’s a reliable bus service that’s reasonably priced.</p>
<h3>Activities for the itchy feet</h3>
<p>You’re spoiled for choice with activities - bike tours, guided walks and diving to name a few. It’s also a good base to explore other parts of the island.</p>
<p>The Levada walking trails don’t come into the city but there are some lovely coastal paths or you can just take the time to wander the city. To see the Levada trails we always recommend booking with a guide.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Funchal with Inghams?</h2>
<p>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Funchal include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Madeira's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>
<p>Plus, we've included two optional guided walks every week in Madeira. Join a professional walking guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Public Transport</h3>
<p>Getting around the local area of Funchal is easy to do by bus, the main centre has a good network of routes available that are reliable and reasonably priced. </p>
<p>If you’re looking to explore more of Madeira then we recommend booking onto some of our excursions to see more of the island as the bus service outside of the local Funchal area is less reliable and hard to navigate.</p>
<h3>Cable Cars</h3>
<p>With its mountainous terrain its no surprise that Madeira has a number of cable cars across the island. In Funchal you'll find one to connect you to the parish of Monte, the views are superb and the botanical gardens are worth a visit (bookable and payable locally).</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Explore Funchal's bustling streets, exciting activities, and delicious food & wine in this year-round summer destination]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Explore Funchal's botanical gardens</h3>
<p>Funchal is the perfect holiday destination for garden and flower enthusiasts. Flowers thrive in Madeira’s tropical climate so you’ll see a whole host of floral displays. Madeira Botanical Gardens have five hectors to explore with tropical plants and array of colourful flowers, while Monte Palace Tropical Gardens are a must-see in the summer with over 100,000 species of plants and 70,000m² of gardens.</p>
<p>The Palheiro Gardens sit within a large estate on the outskirts of Funchal and are also worth a visit. There are a variety of plants to see as well as a great hill-top location, allowing for wonderful views towards the Funchal bay.</p>
<p>A number of our hotels offer fantastic gardens but the <a data-udi="umb://document/13f581d48ab540af80b7e9f149ab1508" href="/{localLink:umb://document/13f581d48ab540af80b7e9f149ab1508}" title="Quinta Splendida">Quinta Splendida</a> in Caniço is truly spectacular. You’ll find 30,000m² of Botanical Gardens with an abundance of plants and flowers to admire.</p>
<h3>Try Funchal's local food and drink</h3>
<p>If you’re partial to a sweet wine then Madeiran wine might be the tipple for you, famous for its rich, sweet taste it can be enjoyed in many local bars but also in a number of wine tasting venues across the island.</p>
<p>On the local drinks menu you’re also likely to come across a Poncha. This rum-based cocktail was said to be what the local fisherman used to drink to warm themselves at sea.</p>
<p>Black scabbardfish is considered a delicacy in Madeira as fishing it isn’t an easy task. You’ll normally find it served with fried banana, it’s unusual but delicious!</p>
<p>Espetada Madeirense is a must-have on your holiday. Its beef that’s normally marinated in a salt and garlic rub, placed on a bay leaf or laurel skewer and grilled. It’s delicious!</p>
<h3>Admire Funchal’s historic port and marina</h3>
<p>Funchal is often compared to an amphitheatre that sits around its marina and we have to admit, it does make for a good show. The port which was built in the 19th century was a popular stopping point for many steamers crossing the Atlantic and was so until the Second World War.</p>
<p>The marina is great for a bit of boat spotting or watching the world go by but if its history you’re after then head to the Forte de Sao Tiago. At nearly 400 years old you can see the toll the sea has taken on this historic fort which was thought to have been built as a defence against pirates to protect the city of Funchal. Sometimes it is open for visitors to wander around the inside (at a fee, payable locally).</p>
<h3>Wander Funchal’s old town</h3>
<p>Funchal’s historic core has some buildings said to date back to the 15th century. In the area you’ll find charming and historic architecture, small alleyways and a lively atmosphere. Walk down the street of Santa Maria to experience the colourful and vibrant painted doors, that brought life back to the area after devastating floods. Or head to the Mercado dos Lavradores to experience some locally-grown fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>The old town also has lots of restaurants and small shops, many selling local crafts. Keep an out for the beautiful black and white tiled floors, resembling a mosaic. Some are patterned whilst some depict people or objects.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<h3>Funchal's museums</h3>
<p>Madeira is home to many museums and historic monuments but here’s a few of our favourites...</p>
<ul>
<li>Casa Museu Frederico de Freitas is not only a beautiful building but also offers a great collection of art and objects on display</li>
<li>Museu da Eletricidade of Funchal is, as the name suggests, all around the history of electricity on the island, it might sound a little niche but its actually a really interesting display or engineering whilst detailing the history of the island – its also great value for money</li>
<li>And then there's the CR7 museum, dedicated to the football legend, Cristiano Ronaldo who grew up in Madeira. You’ll find memorabilia and even a few of his trophies that follow and describe the timeline of his career</li>
</ul>
<h3>Island hop to Porto Santo</h3>
<p>For those looking to discover beautiful beaches they don't get more beautiful than on the island of Porto Santo, the boat journey is a little long (about two and half hours) but it's well worth it. </p>
<h3>Madeira's calendar of events</h3>
<p>Madeira offers a busy events calendar with many throughout the year from the Madeira roller Marathon to classic car events there’s lots to enjoy. Please be aware that some events are ticketed and may need to be booked and paid in advance, event dates are approximate and should be checked before booking. Here are a few of our favourite events listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Madeira Flower Festival, usually held in April or May: Arguably Madeira’s most iconic festival, experience the parade, the flower carpets or the Wall of Hope amongst many other celebrations taking place across the event</li>
<li>Carnival, usually held early to mid-February: Take in vibrant costumes, music and dance on the small parades travelling through the streets of Funchal and other events taking place across the city</li>
<li>Madeira Rum Festival, usually held around mid-April: You’ll find local rum producers at this event along with a lively atmosphere and maybe even the chance to taste the product</li>
<li>Madeira Classic Car Revival, usually held at the end of May: Car lovers and non-car lovers will enjoy this event, some of the best classic and vintage cars are brought in from across the region for spectators to marvel over</li>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended Equipment</h3>
<p>The weather can be unpredictable in Madeira and whilst it can be sunny by the coast the weather in the mountains may be quite different and can change quickly. We recommend taking rain jackets and suitable walking clothing that caters to changing climates. Always ensure you have the correct shoes for hiking that offer good grip and support, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Hiking Guidelines</h3>
<p>Maderia has lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>We always recommend hiking with a professional guide in Madeira</li>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>We always recommend walking with a professional guide as starting points can be hard to reach and routes can be difficult to navigate so it’s always good to have an expert on hand</li>
<li>The sun sets very quickly in Madeira so always make sure you plan enough time to complete your walk before nightfall</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or venture into technical walking routes without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Madeira</h3>
<p>We love Funchal as a base for walking, the city has so much to offer and those sea views are hard to beat. Whether you’re looking to explore the island on foot and journey a little outside the city to hit the levadas or relax and breath in that sea air then Funchal caters to all.</p>
<p>The trails and Levadas are what make Madeira a truly unique destination for walking – the mountains make for some fantastic scenery along the way and the mild year-round climate doesn’t hurt either. From Funchal you’re only a short journey from some of the nearby levadas but we always recommend walking with a professional guide as starting points can be hard to reach and routes can be difficult to navigate so it’s always good to have an expert on hand. You can also join a guided walk. You get two included with your holiday but if you’re looking to do more, no problem, head to our excursions to see what additional walks you can join (extra charge).</p>
<h3>Guided Walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included guided walks per holiday, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge. Pre-booking is essential - check out the <a data-udi="umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063" href="/{localLink:umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063}" title="Guided Walks">Guided Walks</a> section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
