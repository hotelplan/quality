  <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking for luxury then the Cliff Bay Hotel delivers on all accounts. Enjoy exquisite views, direct access to the sea, delicious dining experiences and excellent service.</p>
<h2>World-class dining</h2>
<p>The Cliff Bay is a foodies dream with excellent food on offer as well as a variety of dining experiences. The two-star Michelin restaurant is its crown jewel with exquisite food imaginatively presented and excellent service, making it a dinner to remember (bookable and payable locally). For days lounging by the pool head to the Blue Lagoon restaurant for lunch, with its light menu options, and a bar so you’re sure to enjoy all it has to offer, guests on full board can also enjoy lunch here with set menu. The Rose Garden Restaurant is where guests on half board and full board can enjoy dinner, it always has a welcoming atmosphere and an internationally inspired set menu. In the evenings we love to head to the Cliff Bar, not only will you find a great cocktail menu amongst other delicious beverages (payable locally) but if you’re lucky you might also get to enjoy some live music. </p>
<h2>Located on the water’s edge</h2>
<p>The views at the Cliff Bay are breath taking with sweeping views out towards the sea and the city of Funchal. Enjoy a stroll around the manicured lawns where you’ll find palm trees, tropical flowers and ocean views that are hard to beat. For those wanting to cool off, the hotel has a platform stretching out into the water that gives you direct access to the sea via a ladder. You’ll also find a salt-water pool at sea level with great views - perfect for an afternoon dip.</p>
<h2>A variety of facilities to choose from</h2>
<p>Like the hotel, the facilities are also 5*, the list just goes on and on. In the wellness area you’ll find an indoor/outdoor pool, as well as a whirlpool, gym, sauna and relaxation room. Outside, you’ll find a number of pools including one for children and another with fantastic views over the ocean. For those wanting to break a sweat, you’ll find a well-equipped fitness room or if you’re looking for a little competition then head out to the tennis courts (payable locally).</p>
<h2>Exceptional service</h2>
<p>Like most things at The Cliff Bay, service is of the highest standard. Guests are continuously commenting on the exceptional service from the friendly staff that are always on hand to help – nothing is too much trouble.</p>]]></description>
