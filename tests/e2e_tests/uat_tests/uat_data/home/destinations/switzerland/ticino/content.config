  <description><![CDATA[<p>Although Ticino was annexed from the Dukes of Milan by the Swiss Confederation as long ago as the 15th century, over 500 years later this most southerly of the Swiss cantons still has a strong Latin flavour to it - Italian culture and language intermingles with Swiss quality and efficiency, making it a fascinating location for a holiday in <a data-udi="umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.</p>
<p><br />Situated in the foothills of the Swiss Alps, and on the border with <a data-udi="umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904}" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the region of Ticino enjoys a wonderfully warm climate and offers guests all the efficiency of Switzerland but with an added 'Italian-style' flair. The area is dominated by <a data-udi="umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48" href="/{localLink:umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48}" title="Lake Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a> and Lake Lugano, both of which extend into present day Italy, and some marvellous mountains such as the UNESCO World Heritage site of Monte San Giorgo. The dramatic scenery is not just natural but also man-made – for instance, the 220m high hydro-electric Contra Dam near <a data-udi="umb://document/7b760653f95440289f984892a9c33c31" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7b760653f95440289f984892a9c33c31}" title="Locarno">Locarno</a> where the dramatic opening sequence in the James Bond film ‘Goldeneye’ was filmed. From Locarno you can also visit beautiful Ascona 10 minutes by bus or 20 minutes by boat.</p>
<p>The area enjoys a sunny climate and is rich in history and culture. The Castles of Bellinzona are another UNESCO World Heritage site, there is plenty of classic architecture, and you’ll find quite a few museums and markets, and even a music festival or two on your holiday in Ticino. The region is also a paradise for garden lovers with exotic, colourful flora and several botanical gardens in close proximity. Guests can relax in the sun on a lake cruise, enjoy a delicious 'panini unch or cappucino on one of the 'Piazzas' or cool off in the outdoor pool at one of our hotels. <br /><br />Get a feel for Ticino, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlRKoMj-EF4&amp;list=PLWrXDQnZTbN_zJ0wKtO-CVdJ8EvpoJyM5&amp;index=4" target="_blank" title="Ticino Experience More Resort Video">watch our resort video here</a> to experience more.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Walking in Ticino 192-1,340 metres (Cardada)</strong><br /><br /><strong>From Lugano</strong></p>
<p>Lugano is the perfect place for a leisurely stroll along the lakeside or in the cobbled streets of the old town. More energetic walkers can take one of several funiculars up to the hills to follow the challenging walking trails through the colourful landscape. Monte Bré is accessible by funicular and offers a variety of well-marked trails from gentle walks to more difficult trails up to the peaks.</p>
<p><strong>From Locarno/Ascona</strong></p>
<p>There are many scenic walks in and around Locarno and Ascona which are a pleasant one-hour lakeside stroll apart. The Cardada, reached by funicular and cable-car from Locarno centre also offers varied mountain short walks and more challenging hikes, all with breathtaking views of Lake Maggiore, or head into the hills and the Verzasca Valley for typical Ticino scenery. For flower lovers, a visit to the Brissago islands is a must. The climate allows over 1,500 species of plants to flourish here, many of which are unique to Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Exploring the Swiss Transport Network</h3>
<p>Switzerland’s excellent public transport network of mountain railways, cable-cars, boats and buses makes it a pleasure to explore the sights independently, at your own pace. Some of the excursions below cross the border into Italy.</p>
