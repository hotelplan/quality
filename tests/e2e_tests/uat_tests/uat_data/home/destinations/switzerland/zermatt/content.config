  <description><![CDATA[<p>Zermatt is practically synonymous with the Matterhorn. This Swiss mountain town has long been a launch pad for mountaineers aiming for the notorious 4,478 metre peak – but the Matterhorn is just one of 38 mountains over 4,000 metres in the area, making for dramatic scenery perfect for exploring on footpaths weave from villages and valleys, through gorges and Alpine meadows to the rockier terrain above. It’s easy to get carried away exploring the spectacular surroundings, but ensure you make time for wandering the pretty town and enjoying the views from one of Zermatt’s many sunny café terraces. This is also the realm of cycling, climbing, high ropes, and via ferrata routes – even year-round glacier skiing.</p>
<h3>Relax on holiday in Zermatt</h3>
<p>Before the 19th Century race to climb the Matterhorn made Zermatt famous, the residents were quietly getting on with farming the green pastures here. Many of the old wooden buildings still frame the pedestrianised streets, window boxes overflowing with flowers. You can take your pick of bars, restaurants, and shops – and of the suntrap terraces made for sipping a coffee under the watchful eye of the Matterhorn. To find out more about how mountaineering transformed Zermatt, duck into the underground Matterhorn Museum.</p>
<h3>Exploring the Matterhorn region</h3>
<p>The highest cable car in Europe takes adventurers up to Klein Matterhorn (3,883 metres). It’s no relation to the actual Matterhorn, which lies just a few kilometres across the mountain pass but offers exceptional views of some of the highest glaciers and summits in the Alps, including Mont Blanc. Aptly named the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise, it's an Alpine wonderland up here. The restaurant serves Alpine food and wine, while a cinema screens short films of Zermatt’s wildlife and mountaineering history. Get a glimpse of life beneath the glacier in the Ice Palace or take a panoramic trip on the new Matterhorn Alpine Crossing – a luxurious cable car that connects Zermatt with the Italian village of Breuil-Cervinia.</p>
<h3>Beyond the Matterhorn: mountains, lakes and gorges</h3>
<p>Despite what some might say, there are mountains beyond the Matterhorn. Dive into the challenging trails of the Rothorn or visit the chapel at Schwarzee, dedicated to Mary of the Snows; it’s something of a sacred touchstone for mountaineers. The network of lifts and mountain railways around Zermatt makes getting to the best viewpoints easy and there's every flavour of a footpath to discover. On the outskirts of town, staircases and boardwalks lead deep into the Gorner Gorge, which is a natural spectacle, showcasing the power of nature.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Zermatt: mini mountain adventures</h3>
<p>Gornergrat is one of the most family-friendly mountains in Zermatt. For starters, you get to travel aboard a 19th-century cog railway with views of the Matterhorn and the Monte Rosa massif. At the top, you can meet the cute black-nosed sheep that graze on the pastures, admire the plants in the highest Alpine garden in Europe, or wander one of the many well-signposted footpaths. Alternatively, take the funicular up to the playgrounds and swimming lakes of Sunnegga.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Meet the sheep</h3>
<p>Traditional, black-nosed sheep spend their summer grazing the pastures of the Gornergrat, and thanks to the shepherdess, you can meet them. They’re tracked with GPS so are easy to find as they laze in the sun and graze in the meadows - Shepherdess Nathalie is happy to share interesting information about her woolly companions.</p>
<h3>Wolli Wonderland</h3>
<p>Enjoy family time outdoors and solve puzzles as you go at Wolli Wonderland – an exciting family trail that has 17 stops with puzzle exhibits and play areas. Learn about the wild animals of Zermatt, help Wolli find Mitza the cat, and have lots of fun along the way.</p>
<p>There’s also Wolli’s Adventure Park at Sunnegga, where there’s an adventure playground, mini beach, and barbeque areas by the Leisee Lake. The lake is also a popular place for a cooling afternoon dip.</p>
<h3>Furi Adventure World</h3>
<p>A day trip to the mountain hamlet of Furi gives lots of options for exploration, from the Furi Suspension Bridge to the Gorner Gorge. There’s a charming playground at the Dossen glacier garden, the Ricola herb garden and spots to barbeque too.</p>
<h3>Swim and relax at Schalisee Lake</h3>
<p>The Schalisee lake is the ideal spot for a relaxing afternoon, with lake swims and games on the grass. It’s easy to get to, on the walking trail that links Täsch and Randa, and there are plenty of trees for shade and picnic tables. For the children, there’s a playground and beach volleyball area, plus the Bike Zone Schali with pump track and skills loop and a small cable wake park too.</p>
<h3>Adrenaline activities for adventurous teens</h3>
<p>There’s plenty going on in Zermatt to get the adrenaline pumping – feel the wind in your hair on a kick-bike at Sunnegga, or dirt scooters at Schwarzsee. Ride a mountain cart 1.6 kilometres down the mountain from Blauherd to Sunnegga or test your head for heights on the Forest Fun Park following courses of zip lines and obstacles high above the ground – there’s a course for younger kids too.</p>]]></festivals>

<h3>Public Transport</h3>
<p>The Swiss transport system make getting around an absolute pleasure, and in addition to the mountain railways and lifts, there's also a network of local buses and trains.</p>
<p>The Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn runs down the valley from Zermatt, through neighbouring villages of Täsch and Randa, before continuing down to Visp and beyond, for connections further afield. You'll get your Swiss Half Fare Card included in the price of your holiday so will get discount on trains and other modes of transport, and if you choose to purchase the Zermatt Peak Pass, travel on the train between Zermatt, Täsch and Randa is included, opening up further walking opportunities.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The walking in Zermatt is so good that every route could be classed as a favourite, but here are just a few routes that we really love:</p>
<h3>Botanical Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>4km (one way)</li>
<li>732 metres of height gain</li>
</ul>
<p>Look out for the elusive wild Edelweiss, colourful blue gentians and varieties of orchid on this trail that nature lovers will enjoy just as much as the butterflies that call these meadows home. This route starts in Zermatt and heads uphill to Trift following the Botanischer Lerhpfad signs - expect to take just over four hours for the full route (there and back).</p>
<h3>Walk the Gorner Gorge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk on wooden walkways</li>
<li>Open end of May to mid-October</li>
</ul>
<p>This spectacular journey through the deep Gorner Gorge is only around a 15-minute walk from Zermatt and is an exciting adventure for the whole family. See how the glacial water has carved deeper and deeper through the 220 million year old rock to form deep chasms and waterfalls. (Entry fee of around CHF5.00 for adults and CHF2.50 for children).</p>
<h3>Five Lakes Walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>9.8km</li>
<li>165 metres of height gain and 454 metres of height loss</li>
</ul>
<p>This hike is a Zermatt classic. Discover five uniquely beautiful mountain lakes on this varied and exciting trail. See the reflection of the Matterhorn in the lakes, take a refreshing swim and look out for rare wild flowers. This hike starts at the Blauherd mountain station and follows the 5-Seenweg signs all the way to Sunnegga - expect to take around two and a half to three hours.</p>
<h3>Hike to the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the Alps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to challenging hike</li>
<li>Various starting points:
<ul>
<li>from Randa - two to two and a half hours walk</li>
<li>from Grächen - six to seven hours walk</li>
<li>from Zermatt - six to seven hours walk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requires a good head for heights</li>
<li>Open May to October</li>
<li>Do not cross in a storm</li>
</ul>
<p>The Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is exciting bridge that's almost 500 metres long and at the highest point, is 85 metres above the valley floor. Most easily accessed from Randa, to form part of a rewarding day hike with stunning views of towering mountains and glaciers.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Zermatt - famed for the Matterhorn and its mountaineering history. A charming mountain town with lots to discover]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>An authentic mountain village</h3>
<p>Wander the quaint village streets and discover boutique shops, mouth-watering pastries, and Swiss-made chocolate. Get a taste of the local culture with various folklore evenings and concerts throughout the summer, or visit some of the churches and chapels in the town. The Matterhorn Museum in the village centre gives an interesting insight into Zermatt's history.</p>
<p>August is a bustling month for the village, with the 1st of August being Swiss National Day - expect traditional music and fireworks to celebrate. The largest cultural event of the summer is undoubtedly the Folklore Festival (normally around 12-13 August) where the weekend is taken over with tradition, dancing and music, colourful costumes, and tasty traditional food. </p>
<h3>Visit the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</h3>
<p>Enjoy unrivaled views from the highest cable car station in Europe at 3,883 metres above sea level. You'll need plenty of time to explore up here as the air is quite thin, but the views will certainly keep you entertained for a long while. You can also visit the Glacier Palace which is a network of tunnels and caves 15 metres below the surface of the ice, with sculptures and an ice toboggan run. </p>
<p>Why not take a trip to Italy while you're there, too? The new 3S cable car link completes the Matterhorn Alpine Crossing which enables cable car travel over into Italy on a stunning panoramic journey.</p>
<h3>Exciting active adventures</h3>
<p>From mountain biking and paragliding, mountain carting to dirt scooting, Zermatt is an adrenaline lover's dream. Try a bit of summer skiing on the 21 kilometres of pistes open all year round, or hop on a bike and explore some of the steady flow trails or more technical alpine routes, all with stunning mountain views. Teenagers and adventurous adults will love the Forest Fun high ropes course or perhaps try some via Ferrata, which is climbing a network of iron pegs in the mountainside, and taking mountain hiking to another level.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in Zermatt</h3>
<p>With nearly 400 kilometres of marked walking trails in the area that cater to all abilities there is so much to explore. You can take a leisurely stroll to gourmet mountain huts, walk to bucket-list viewpoints, enjoy memorable family adventures or take on an athletic challenge in nature. </p>
