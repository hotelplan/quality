  <description><![CDATA[<p>Davos has welcomed wanderers for centuries and it's the perfect spot for a summer holiday in the Swiss mountains. It’s known as Tavau in Romansh - the language of the people who founded the town in the Middle Ages. Several centuries later, it was reinvented as a mountain health resort that cared for the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson and became a centre for speed skating and ice hockey in the snow-laden winters. Come summer, the mountain slopes shed their snow and it’s the turn of the hikers and bikers. Walking holidays to Davos are your chance to explore some of the 700 kilometres’ worth of trails around here – as well as the local rail network which includes the incomparably scenic Bernina Express.</p>
<h3>Davos: the little city determined to change the world</h3>
<p>Davos has always been a little place with big ambitions, going from Middle Age village to star-studded health resort to a darling of the ski world. These days, it hosts the World Economic Forum and is home to world-class research centres for everything from allergies to avalanches. And yet it still feels like a small town. You can walk from one end of Davos to the other in less than an hour… if you manage to resist the art galleries, restaurants, spas, historic forest cemetery and lake in-between, that is.</p>
<h3>Easy escapes into nature</h3>
<p>You don’t have to go far to get out into nature. The Landwasser river runs through Davos and the lake glimmers at the city’s northern edge - peacock-blue waters filled with sailing boats, wakeboarders, pedalos and paddle boarders. Stroll the water’s edge to admire the forested foothills and mountains layered beyond. Footpaths and a funicular clamber up to the Schatzalp alpine gardens, which showcase herbs, kitchen vegetables, wildflowers and botanical plants from around the world - as well as beautiful views and walking trails, of course.</p>
<h3>Walser valleys and historic wine routes</h3>
<p>For adventures a little further afield, jump aboard the buses and distinctive scarlet trains that chug through the green valleys. You can choose from easy valley rambles such as Sertig - where the Walser people settled in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, building distinctive wooden farmsteads that are still working farms today - or choose a more challenging hike to see the lakes set high in the wild glacial valleys.</p>
<p>The long-distance Via Valtellina route also runs through Davos. This vital pack mule route once kept towns en route supplied with wine from the Valtellina region over the Italian border. The section that runs south from Davos leads through peaceful valleys and – if you’re feeling energetic – to the Scaletta Pass, the highest point of the route at just over 2,000 metres. These trails are also a hit with mountain bikers; in fact, the Davos region is one of the best places for mountain biking in Switzerland.</p>
<h3>The Flüela Valley: from families to sunset chasers</h3>
<p>Davos Adventure Park lays out zip lines, high ropes and tree-top challenges amongst the forests at the mouth of the Flüela Valley, along with pump tracks and a skatebowl. Continue up the valley, and you’ll come across a high mountain pass that marks the drainage divide between the Rhine and Danube rivers. It’s spectacular up there at any time of day, but really shines at sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p>The Flüela Pass is also the start of walks to the Jöriseen lakes – bright turquoise jewels set into dramatically bleak mountain plateaus. Alternatively, hop on a bike and pedal to the scenic hut at Alp Sardasca, cutting down a three-hour hike to a 1.5-hour bike ride. Best of all, the zoom back downhill only takes 45 minutes.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Davos</h2>
<h3>Pram-friendly hiking trails</h3>
<p>Even the smallest adventurers can enjoy the fresh air and mountain views. There are plenty of pram-friendly routes in and around Davos Klosters. Take a stroll from Davos Platz to Davos Frauenkirch on the gentle one-hour Dammweg Islen trail, or head up the gondola to the Jakobshorn for an easy 7-kilometre stroll down the mountain on wide paths.</p>
<h3>Themed paths and trails</h3>
<p>Let the little detectives loose as they take on the Davos foxtrail. Come across lots of easy routes ranging from as little as 0.4 kilometres to over 13 kilometres, on one of the eight GWunderwald nature trails. With interactive courses, information boards, and fun obstacles along the way, children will love these walks.</p>
<h3>Playgrounds</h3>
<p>Children will be in their element as the nearby parks provide exceptional theming and fun equipment for all ages. The Spielplatz Davos Kurpark is a vibrant insect themed park, or the Eichhörnchen is an enchanted fox and squirrel play village. Whether in the town or on the mountain, you won't run out of playgrounds to visit here.</p>
<h3>Adventure Park</h3>
<p>The rope park at the base of the Flüela pass offers five courses, covering high wires and cycling parks. Harness up as you brave the climbing walls, elevated logs, zip-lines and tricky obstacles. The main courses are for children aged seven plus who are at least 1.30 metres tall, and a smaller adventurer's course is available too, for kids aged four and above.</p>
<h3>Bike pumptracks</h3>
<p>If the kids love a thrill, they'll have endless fun at the Davos pumptracks. Davos Adventure Park has small pump tracks for beginners, and larger dirt tracks for keen bikers and teens. You might even have a future mountain bike champion on the cards after practising their biking techniques here.</p>
<h3>Scootering</h3>
<p>This unique piece of equipment has mountain grade wheels, but in a scooter form – almost like a cross between a scooter and bike. Head to the Madrisa Monster trail if your children are 13 or older, or for little ones the Madrisa scooter trail is more friendly and less intense. Don't forget your helmet.</p>
<h3>Disc golf</h3>
<p>Head to the Flüela Valley, where the course at Tschuggen combines frisbee with target obstacles. The aim of the game is to score in the smallest amount of tries – just like golf. There are 18 baskets, so you will pick up the skill as you go.</p>
<h3>Mini golf</h3>
<p>Will you be first to get a hole-in-one? Make your way with the kids to the Hotel Waldhuus Davos for a game of mini-golf. This nine-hole course opened in summer 2023, so why not take to the challenge and see who has the best precision skills.</p>
<h3>Aquatic centre eau-là-là</h3>
<p>For days when the weather is clouded over, or you just fancy a change of scenery, head to the indoor pleasure pool at the aquatic centre. Children can zoom down the 80-metre “black hole” slide or jump off the diving boards. There is also a large indoor and outdoor pool, with an on-site bistro to grab a sandwich at the end of all the fun.</p>]]></festivals>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Davos</h2>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>Footpaths, trails, pavements or rocky inclines? You choose. If you're looking for a nice gentle walk, then the 2.5 mile Lake Davos circular is a walk in the park. Or, for something a bit shorter but more of a challenge, the Schatzalp waterfall loop will have you on a steeper route. With around 700 kilometres of marked trails in the area, this is a hiker's paradise.</p>
<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>Davos Klosters is known as the single-track paradise of the Alps. Here there's lots of alpine passes and mountain trails, so hold on to your handlebars tight, you're in for a ride. Looking for a moderate ride? Then the Flüela Valley trails from Davos bike park Färich are incredible leg burners, or hop on the “Bike Shuttle Davos” to help with the ascent.</p>
<h3>Kirchner Museum in Davos</h3>
<p>Step into the world of art as you see how Ernst Kirchner expressed his thoughts through paintings. These vibrant masterpieces are a must see when visiting Davos. With more than 1,400 art works by the creator himself, you can unlock a cultural experience at just a little cost.</p>
<h3>Davos Heritage museum</h3>
<p>Visit the original wooden mill at the Grossen Jenatschhaus, an old house from the 16th century. Covering tradition, history and culture, you'll explore how Davos has transformed from a farming village to a spa and sports town, popular for congress too.</p>
<h3>Mountain railways and the famous Bernina Express</h3>
<p>You can enjoy a ride in the Parsenn funicular, climbing to 2,693 metres high, via two stages to the Weissfluhjoch. Here you will experience breathtaking views as far as Piz Kesch and 60 kilometres to the south.</p>
<p>For the real wow factor, take the scenic Bernina Express Panoramic Train, which rolls through jaw-dropping scenery and over famous landmarks like the Landwasser Viaduct all the way to Tirano in Italy - a spectacular route that's easily completed there and back in a day from Filisur, not far from Davos.</p>
<h3>Culinary experiences</h3>
<p>The Clavadeler Alp cheese factory or the Monstein brewery are both within easy reach and worthy of a visit. Davos Klosters is home to over 140 restaurants, meaning you can opt for a cosy inn one night, to a gourmet fine dining experience the next. Try some of the local delicacies like Salsiz and Bündnerfleisch - both are air-dried meats, popular in the Graubünden region.</p>
<h3>Nine-hole alpine golf</h3>
<p>Golf Club Klosters may be little when it comes to golf courses, however it is mighty in location. This super friendly club has beautiful greens and a stunning mountainous backdrop. It’s a great outdoors activity for a summer's day, so it's time to get some chipping in.</p>
<h3>Schatzalp toboggan run</h3>
<p>Take in the 360-degree views as you speed down the 2.5-kilometre run, covering a 240-metre drop in altitude. This activity is family friendly too, for anyone over the age of six. Who says adults can't have fun as well?</p>
<h3>Shopping along the Davos promenade</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a bit of retail therapy, then Davos promenade is a fantastic place to visit during your stay. With a range of sports shops, boutiques, international brands, hand crafts, Swiss watch and jewellery shops, you have plenty to choose from. You can even grab one of the historical posters from many shops, a popular souvenir when travelling to Davos.</p>
<h3>Davos Schatzalp Alpine Botanical Garden</h3>
<p>The Alpine Botanical Garden Schatzalp has five acres of gardens and 118 acres of forest and mountain pastures. The alpine gardens are themed, with names including belle époque, historical, Thomas Mann square and 'Guggerbachtal' (valley of the Guggerbach river) - each with a different collection of plants and representing various areas of life. In total, the gardens are home to over 5,000 species of plant from all over the world, with a focus on species like Edelweiss, Enzian, Peonies, Larkspur, Monkshood, Spurg, wild Geranium, Bellflower and many others from high altitude landscapes of our world. </p>
<h3>Davos Klosters Summer programme</h3>
<p>The Davos Klosters Summer programme of activities and hikes throughout summer including weekly guided bike tours, tennis, windsurfing, a tour of highest-altitude Monstein brewery, E-biking, bowling, dairy visits and more. Your Davos Klosters Premium Card may get you discounts on some activities <em>(subject to change, some supplements may apply for equipment etc. and some activities will be payable locally</em>).</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps and apps</h3>
<p>For Davos we recommend picking up a walking map from the tourist office. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. You can often find these from the hotel reception area too.</p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Davos</h3>
<p>There are around 700 kilometres of marked walking trails in the Davos Klosters region, offering a fabulous range of walks to suit all abilities and tastes. The vast walking area which covers both sides of the valley is accessed easily by cable-car or funicular from the village centres and the Davos Klosters Premium Card makes using the lifts much cheaper so you can explore the stunning terrain and get to the best view points, really easily.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The Davos Klosters Summer Guest Programme includes some guided hikes, and you can use your Davos Klosters Premium Card for a reduced rate to join. You can also visit the Tourist Office website to sign up to further guided walks - these need to be arranged directly with the Tourist Office two weeks in advance which can be done online.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
