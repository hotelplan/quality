  <description><![CDATA[<p>With an “off the beaten track” feel, if you’re looking for unspoiled, traditional Swiss village charm, outstanding Alpine walking, and the wow factor, then book a summer holiday to Kandersteg. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, don’t let the peaceful village atmosphere deceive you because there are a ton of things to do here - over 550 kilometers of walking paths, picturesque mountain lakes and passes, and lots for the adrenaline junkies.</p>
<h3>A summer holiday in Kandersteg: exploring the area</h3>
<p>Kandersteg is everything you expect from a pretty Swiss village with traditional wooden chalets, brightly coloured flower boxes, and a 16th Century church. Grab a morning coffee in one of the cafés before wandering the streets - look out for the stunning engraved façade of Landgasthof Ruedihus, a hotel and restaurant that is 250 years old, and the Ricola Herb garden. Then head out of the village to Blausee Nature Park and museum and experience the clear lake waters in a glass-bottom boat.</p>
<h3>Visit Lake Oeschinensee - A UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
<p>Prepare for jaw-dropping beauty! With its crystal-clear turquoise waters and the mountains in the background, Lake Oeschinensee is one of the most beautiful lakes in the Alps and makes for some amazing photos! Hire a rowing boat and drift lazily from the shore, linger lakeside for something to eat in one of the restaurants or huts, or try the 750 metre toboggan run with a drop of 150 metres! There's some beautiful walking up here too - take one of the higher trails towards Unterbergli or Oberbergli mountain huts to enjoy spectacular views of the lake from above.</p>
<h3>Walking in Kandersteg: alpine passes and trails</h3>
<p>Get off the tourist trail and discover traditional villages and the vast undeveloped landscape of the Lötschen Valley. But you don’t have to go far to go big, and in Kandersteg, you can also enjoy gentle walking along the River Kander or a visit to the Gasterntal - a glacier valley with vast waterfalls, wildlife, and forests.</p>
<p>Follow in the footsteps of Picasso and Sherlock Holmes as you explore the Gemmi Pass under the watchful eyes of Mount Matterhorn and Monte Rosa. The views are amazing! Or tick off a bucket-list walk and complete a section of the famous Via Alpina long-distance walking trail.</p>
<h3>Active holidays in Kandersteg</h3>
<p>For the bold, the Allmenalp Via Ferrata is a grade K4 climb on the outskirts of Kandersteg, which crosses a river and waterfalls, rewarding your hard work and courage with stunning views. Or take your bike up to the Sunnbüel by cable car - there's an exhilarating downhill trail that will get the adrenaline pumping. And don’t forget to have a go on the summer mountain toboggan or paragliding over the mountains. It doesn’t get much more wow factor than that!</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Kandersteg with Inghams?</h2>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time at your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Kandersteg’s best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Kandersteg</h2>
<h3>Summer tobogganing</h3>
<p>Zoom down the incredible 750-metre-long mountain coaster at the Oeschinen mountain station and create unforgettable memories. Children aged three to eight can brave the ride accompanied by an adult, and older children can take it on themselves, but who will go the fastest?</p>
<h3>Mountain tubing</h3>
<p>Grab your donut and make your way up the ski jumping slopes at the Swisscom Nordic Arena, ready for an exhilarating ride down to the bottom. Fun for the whole family, this giant slide will have you holding on tight as you speed to the bottom. Even the grown-ups will be wanting to go again and again.</p>
<h3>BBQ lunches</h3>
<p>There's nowhere quite like the mountain riverside, or alpine forest to enjoy a family cooked barbeque meal. With various sites providing wood-stocked barbeques and group seating areas, you are in for a treat. But remember, matches must be supplied yourself, so don't forget them.</p>
<h3>Playgrounds</h3>
<p>Head up the Kandersteg Sunnbüel lift and swing from left to right on a giant hammock, or take a leisurely stroll to the Oeschiwald playground and let the little ones woosh down the slide. Lots of restaurants have their own play parks too, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<h3>Outdoor swimming pool</h3>
<p>Get your swimsuit on and make your way to the centre of Kandersteg, heading straight for the outdoor pool with slide, games and wind-protected sunbathing area for the parents. Children can jump in the pool and cool off on a warm day after running around playing ball games on the lawn.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Kandersteg and the surrounding area has a great network of buses and trains, plus a selection of mountain lifts, that make exploring the area really easy.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>There's three lifts from Kandersteg village up to different parts of the mountains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oeschinen (normally open mid-May - mid-Oct)</li>
<li>Allmenalp (normally open around 18 May - 20 Oct)</li>
<li>Sunnbüel (normally open end-May - mid-Oct)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy lift tickets individually, or purchase a <a rel="noopener" href="https://meine-berge.ch/en/magicblue/" target="_blank">Magic Blue Pass</a> which includes one ascent and descent on each lift. Alternatively, you can pre-book a Bernese Oberland Pass and enjoy unlimited use of all three lifts, and many others in the local area - see the "Cards &amp; Passes" tab for further details on how to add this to your holiday.</p>
<p>If you're keen to explore more of the local area, there are further walker's lifts in Adelboden too.</p>
<p><em>Subject to change.</em></p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>Local buses are included on the Kandersteg Guest Card (given to you by your hotel), enabling you to travel between Kandersteg, Frutigen, Adelboden and Reichenbach, free of charge - timetables and route maps are available locally.</p>
<h3>Trains</h3>
<p><span>The Swiss transport system makes getting around an absolute pleasure, and in addition to the buses and lifts, there's also a great network of trains so you can explore more of the area. It's easy to visit Interlaken or the Jungfrau by train, and we recommend pre-booking a Bernese Oberland Pass which includes lots of the trains, buses and cable cars in the Bernese Oberland area so you can really make the most of this beautiful part of Switzerland.</span></p>]]></gettingAround>

  <guidedWalks><![CDATA[<h3>Inghams Guided Walks are included on your holiday to Kandersteg</h3>
<p>We’ve included up to two full-day walks per week in Kandersteg, just for Inghams guests. Join a small group and be led by a professional walking guide on some of their favourite trails. It’s a great way to get to know the area. The walks in Kandersteg are run by Franz Herger.</p>
<p>In Summer 24, walks are available from 28 May - 19 Sep and in Summer 25, they're available from 27 May - 11 Sep. The walks will run every Tuesday and Thursday and there's different walks from one week to the next - please see specific dates by each walk description. You can add them onto your holiday at the time of booking, through My Booking or by giving us a call.</p>
<h3>Discover the remote valley of Gasterntal</h3>
<p>A trip to the Gasterntal is like entering another world - one of vast mountain panoramas and nature. The road into the valley is chiselled into the rock, and is so narrow it's only passable one direction at a time - after a bit of twisting, turning and a few rock tunnels you'll emerge into the valley and will be surprised by the incredible view. Our walk starts from the Waldhaus Hut and follows the valley to Selden and Gasthaus Heimritz, where we'll stop for lunch (payable locally). Along the way, there's waterfalls, suspension bridges to cross the river and spectacular views.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: easy - moderate (basic fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 9km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time</strong>: approx. 2.5 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 300m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong>: mainly gravel road, footpath or forest trail (can be quite uneven in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: there will be a lunch stop at the Gasthaus Heimritz (payable locally). Use of the hikers' bus to and from Waldhaus is payable locally (approx. CHF20 per person - it isn't included on the Bernese Oberland Pass).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 24, this walk will run on: 28 May, 11 Jun, 25 Jun, 9 Jul, 23 Jul, 6 Aug, 20 Aug, 3 Sep and 17 Sep</p>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 27 May, 10 Jun, 24 Jun, 8 Jul, 22 Jul, 5 Aug, 19 Aug and 2 Sep</p>
<h3>Oeschinensee from above</h3>
<p>The glimmering glacial lake of Oeschinensee is UNESCO World Heritage Site and jaw-droppingly beautiful. On this spectacular walk, we start with the lift and then make our way towards the lake, then up interesting mountain paths to the remote mountain huts of Unterbergli (1794m), Oberbergli (1978m) and Heubergli. The views from this walk must be some of the best in Switzerland and we walk through beautiful forests and mountain pastures on our route - to top it off, there's a possibility of seeing chamois and ibex in this area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: moderate - challenging (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 10km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time</strong>: approx. 3 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 500m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong>: mainly mountain path or forest trail (can be quite uneven and steep in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: there will be a lunch stop (payable locally). Use of the hikers' lift to Oeschinensee is payable locally (or it is included on the pre-bookable Bernese Oberland Pass).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 24, this walk will run on: 30 May, 13 Jun, 27 Jun, 11 Jul, 25 Jul, 8 Aug, 22 Aug, 5 Sep and 19 Sep</p>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 29 May, 12 Jun, 26 Jun, 10 Jul, 24 Jul, 7 Aug, 21 Aug and 4 Sep</p>
<h3>Sunnbüel and Arvenseeli</h3>
<p>Gorgeous views start as soon as we get on the Sunnbüel lift, looking down on Kandersteg and getting a bird's-eye view of the Gasterntal remote valley as we rise. Once at the top, we follow gentle mountain paths to the small and pretty mountain lakes at Arvenseeli - this is the start of the famous Gemmi Pass over towards Lake Dauben and Gemmi. Depending on the group, there's the option to extend the walk to Lake Dauben, or we keep things relaxed and return at a leisurely pace to Sunnbüel - the views on this walk will not disappoint.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: easy - moderate (basic fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 6.5km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time</strong>: approx. 2 hours</li>

<h3>Allmenalp - Ueschenental - Pfadiheim</h3>
<p>Look out for brave climbers on the lift up to Allmenalp - one of Switzerland's most famous via ferrata routes runs alongside the lift, and you can see climbers following the metal ropeway with iron pegs and suspended ladders. The walk starts from the top of the lift, and the views are amazing straight from the start. Walk through remote mountain pastures back down to Kandersteg - this is marmot territory, so keep your eyes out for these little mountain locals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: moderate - challenging (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 7km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time</strong>: approx. 3 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 100m ascent and 500m descent</li>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong>: mainly mountain path or forest trail (can be quite uneven and steep in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: there will be a lunch stop (payable locally). Use of the hikers' lift to Allmenalp is payable locally (or it is included on the pre-bookable Bernese Oberland Pass).</li>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>There's so many incredible walks around Kandersteg, it's hard to pick favourites, but - in addition to the walks in the guided walks section - here's a few we really love:</p>
<h3>Oeschinensee Circular Walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>4km with around 110m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1 hour or more if you spend longer at the lake</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of Oeschinensee has to be seen to be believed - take a leisurely circular walk to the lake that's been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from the top of the Oeschinen gondola station. The direct path is suitable for all or you can take the narrower path to the lake via Läger. See the bright blue water and surrounding impressive mountain peaks - you can wander along the shore, enjoy the view from the restaurant terrace, picnic at one of the many grill spots near the water or even rent a rowing boat to get out on the water. If you do not wish to walk there is an e-shuttle bus that will take you back to the gondola station (runs around every 30 minutes, approx. CHF8 per person - people with reduced mobility and wheelchairs have priority).</p>
<h3>Kandersteg to Blausee</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>5km with around 20m ascent and 300m descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>A pleasant walk downhill to the Kandergrund valley through forest and meadows and along the River Kander. Blausee is an unrivalled natural wonder with its turquoise blue water of the crystal clear lake, the 20-hectare nature park has plenty to offer: an organic trout farm, exploring the lake from a glass bottomed boat, mystical walking trails, barbeque areas, picnic sites and a children’s play park.</p>
<h3>Sunnbüel to Gemmipass</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>10km with around 545m ascent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 3 hours (one way)</li>
<li>Best June to October</li>
</ul>
<p>This route follows the historic Gemmi Pass from Sunnbüel to Gemmi, past the natural mountain lake of Daubensee - enjoy spectacular views along the route through the Alpine meadows. After about three hours of beautiful walking, you'll reach the Gemmi Pass viewing platform - you can see the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa peaks from here. From Gemmi you have a few options, either return to Sunnbüel the same way you came, or head down to Leukerbad - the village in the valley - catch the Gemmi cable car down, but you will get a reduced fare with your Swiss Half Fare Card) or you can walk down the steep path (this is around 4.4km with 996 metres of descent). In Leukerbad, there's a thermal spa, and it will take around 3 hours to get back to Kandersteg via public transport (there's a bus from Leukerbad to Leuk, followed by a train via Brig to Kandersteg).</p>
<h3>Kandersteg to Gasterntal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>8km with around 475m ascent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 3 hours (or more depending how far into the Gasterntal you want to go)</li>
<li>Best June to October</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting walk from the village to the remote valley of Gasterntal, this route takes the mountain hiking route from Sunnbüel cable car base station, following the spectacular Kander river through the Klus gorge - you'll see the power of the water over the waterfalls. You'll pass through a wildlife reserve and steadily climb through the forest - when the valley opens out you'll be surprised by the vast mountain panorama. You can follow the gentle valley paths along the River Kander as far as you wish and can either return the same way or catch the bus back to Kandersteg (make sure you have a reservation - you could also do this route in the other direction, catching the bus to the Gasterntal and walking back to the village).</p>
<h3>Kandersteg to Doldenhornhütte</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>9km with around 750m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around 4 hours</li>
<li>Best June to October</li>
</ul>
<p>This majestic mountain hike takes you high above the village, passing through pine forests to the picturesque mountain hut which offers spectacular views over the village and Oeschinensee. The route starts beside the Waldhotel Doldenhorn and climbs steeply through the forest to the hut located above the tree line. Return to Kandersteg via the path to Oeschiwald and follow the Oeschibach stream into the village centre.</p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Kandersteg</h2>
<h3>Kandersteg Village</h3>
<p>Despite its small size, Kandersteg packs a punch, and a summer holiday will be full of pleasant surprises. The charming town, with River Kander flowing through its centre, is surrounded by mountains on almost all sides - there are only two ways in and one is via a train through a mountain. Head into the Kandersteg Museum to learn a bit about the town's history, from its scouting past to the history of the Swiss Cableways. Keep a look out for the Ricola herb garden where herbs are grown for the famous Swiss Ricola sweets. You can also try a game of bowls, take a dip in the outdoor village pool, or if the weather's bad, head to the indoor climbing wall.</p>
<h3>Visit Oeschinensee - a UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
<p>The striking bright-blue lake that puts Kandersteg on the map - you can't holiday in Kandersteg and not visit Oeschinensee. Enjoy a leisurely stroll through the forests and along the lake edge, take a (chilly!) wild swim or relax with a drink in one of the mountain huts. Or, you can really push the boat out... literally. A small fleet of rowing boats wait on the shore, ready to explore the water - this is the perfect photo opportunity.</p>
<h3>Sunnbüel Cable Car</h3>
<p>It's worth the ride for the view from the lift alone - jaw-dropping beauty as you look down on the Gasterntal remote valley and Kandersteg village. From the top, a leisurely loop will take you to the pretty little mountain lake of Arvenseeli, or for a longer hike you'll be at Daubensee in around two hours - another hour and you'll get to enjoy the view from the historic Gemmi Pass viewing platform above the village of Leuk. </p>
<h3>Adventures on the Allmenalp</h3>
<p>You can catch the lift up, or if you like a challenge and have a good head for heights (and via Ferrata experience) the Allmenalp Via Ferrata is one of Switzerland's most famous climbs, following a metal ropeway of iron pegs and swing bridges hundreds of metres above the ground, plus a suspended ladder - this isn't for the faint-hearted. Opt for the lift for a much more leisurely ascent, and be rewarded with spectacular views and the cutest of mountain huts where the beer fridge is an old wooden trough filled with ice-cold water and classic mountain refreshments (you'll need cash to buy them, though).</p>
<h3>Blausee - the deep blue lake</h3>
<p>Hidden in the forest, the deep blue lake of Blausee was formed by a huge rockfall 15,000 years ago and is now part of Blausee Nature Park, where you can switch off and enjoy some time in nature. Take a peaceful wander around the lake and woodland paths, or head out onto the water on a glass-bottomed rowing boat. There's a gourmet restaurant for refreshments and a play area for the kids, too.</p>
<h3>Gasterntal Remote Valley</h3>
<p>There's a reason the Gasterntal is remote - the only way in by road is a single track, gravel road cut into the rock - this is spectacular mountain engineering at its most authentic. Once you're in the Gasterntal, steep valley sides rise from the gentle valley floor, showing its glacial history. It's a beautiful place to come for easy strolls and gentle bike rides, and there are plenty of exciting walks up higher too.</p>
<h3>Visit Interlaken and Lakes Thun and Brienz</h3>
<p>Explore a little further afield with a day trip to Interlaken - known as the adventure capital of Europe, there's plenty to do here. Take a lunchtime cruise on Lake Thun, or head up to the Harder Kulm viewing platform for views over the town and two lakes. Try some chocolate making at the Funky Chocolate Club or get involved in the adventure with some white-water rafting, kayaking on the lake, or a paraglide. For a more relaxing day, there are plenty of cafés to enjoy the bustling atmosphere, or you can do a hop-on-hop-off style cruise and visit other beautiful spots on the lake like Thun or Speiz. </p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, a good rucksack and walking poles are useful for walking around Kandersteg. There are a few places to buy equipment in the village if necessary and you can rent poles from Grossen Sport (approx. CHF 6 per day).</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>For Kandersteg we recommend picking up a walking map from the tourist office in the village. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the signposts around the area. They will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin.</p>
<p>You can view lots more recommended routes from <a rel="noopener" href="https://kandersteg.ch/en/wandern/" target="_blank">Kandersteg Tourist Board</a>.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
