  <description><![CDATA[<p>A dramatic entrance is guaranteed in Mürren. There are only two ways in, aboard a funicular and mountain railway from Lauterbrunnen or by a cable car that climbs past waterfalls from Stechelberg and up to the village’s picturesque and car-free streets. Here, in the heart of the Jungfrau region, there are views of the mighty peaks and glaciers of the 4,000 metre-plus mountains of Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. The rugged scenery and picture-perfect alpine meadows and plateaus are spectacular walking territory, with over 200 kilometres of marked trails – just remember to make time for the village too. Mürren was founded by Walser people from Valais, who brought their own architectural style, dialect and recipes with them.</p>
<h3>Hiking the Jungfrau region</h3>
<p>You can find everything from scenic valley strolls and waterfall hikes to technical treks around Mürren, making it an excellent base for exploring the Jungfrau region. Allmendhubel is the closest mountain - a funicular delivers walkers up to the panoramic restaurant and paths in just a few minutes. Trace the Flower Trail towards the Mürren-Schilthorn hiking area, looking out for some of the 150 species of wildflowers en route.</p>
<p>Down in the Lauterbrunnen valley, count the waterfalls that cascade down the steep cliffs as you stroll between the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Stechelberg - there are 72 of them (Lauterbrunnen actually means "many fountains"). The Staubbach Falls are probably the most famous, cascading almost 300 metres over the gigantic rock face, and Trümmelbach Falls are particularly impressive, made up of ten glacial falls, hidden within the mountain.</p>
<h3>Schilthorn Mountain</h3>
<p>A cable car sweeps from Mürren to Schilthorn, known to James Bond aficionados as the home of the famous revolving restaurant of Piz Gloria. A spy museum reveals the secrets and challenges of filming on this 2,970 metre mountaintop. Of course, there’s life beyond Bond, including a glass-balconied Skywalk and a Thrill Walk from the gondola station at Birg. That one does exactly what it says on the tin, lining up vertiginous steel walkways and bridges that cling to the cliff.</p>
<p>During summer 24, a new cable car to Schilthorn is under construction - the current cable car is still in use, but a few of the viewing platforms at Schilthorn and Birg may be closed.</p>
<h3>Flower parks and children’s trails</h3>
<p>Mountain parks, playgrounds and picnic spots are sprinkled throughout the Jungfrau region. The Flower Park at the top of Allmendhubel is a favourite with families staying in Mürren. There are slides, zip lines and a neighbouring restaurant serving up Bernese specialities like steak with garlic butter, rösti and cheese fondue made for sharing. Or you can just sip a rosehip tea while taking in the view. Swap the mountain lift for the Children’s Adventure Trail on the way back to Mürren; it leads kids through a series of woodland slides, walkways and rope swings.</p>
<h3>Mürren and more</h3>
<p>Mürren is made for wandering, neatly tucking wooden chalets, viewpoints and pedestrianised streets onto a sky-high green terrace. Fancy exploring further into the mountains? Head out for a day trip to Jungfraujoch. Here, trains take on one of the most scenic journeys in the world, chugging from the pastures of the Bernese Oberland to the highest railway station in Europe. For more in the way of adventure, the twin-lake town of Interlaken is an hour’s journey away by cable car and train.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Mürren</h2>
<h3>Sports centre with swimming pool</h3>
<p>Head to the alpine sports centre in Mürren for an action-packed day with the kids. Go from swimming in the large indoor 25-metre pool, to rolling over the skilled pump track outside. For adults, there is a spa area and gym, and for the youngest guests there is a “Children's paradise” and special children's pool.</p>
<h3>Children's playgrounds</h3>
<p>Make your way up the Allmendhubel funicular to unlock any child's dream - a flower themed park and water labyrinth to explore. Children can zoom down the metal tube slide, swing from giant plant inspired equipment and climb over fun-filled obstacles. Look out for the giant wooden insects too.</p>
<h3>Adventure trail</h3>
<p>The little ones can get involved by whizzing down coloured slides, crawling through log tunnels, and balancing on beams as they make their way down the Allmendhubel hill back to Mürren – a much more fun way than a lift, right?</p>
<h3>Detective trail</h3>
<p>Starting with an exciting journey to Lauterbrunnen via Stechelberg by gondola and post bus, you’ll then set off with 16 puzzles to complete. The expected 2.5 hour duration covers a few secret kilometres as you all solve the riddles along the gentle hike from Grütschalp, via Winteregg to Mürren. Will you find the final treasure chest to get a prize?</p>
<h3>A trip to Interlaken</h3>
<p>Take a day trip to Interlaken, where you have plenty of land and water activities to choose from. Maybe you fancy a gentle cruise on Lake Thun, or a refreshing dip and kayak ride on Lake Brienz. If you have a sweet tooth, then head to the Funky Chocolate Club in the town to make your very own chocolate bars.</p>
<h3>Visit Grindelwald</h3>
<p>If you have thrill seeker children then Grindelwald First is fantastic for its adventure activities – including giant zip lines, a daring cliff walk and speedy mountain cart rides. The fun doesn't stop there, head to the Pfingstegg lift and zoom down the summer toboggan too.</p>]]></festivals>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Mürren</h2>
<h3>Explore the beautiful village</h3>
<p>The serene village is in the perfect location, with stunning views of the three iconic peaks of Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau. There is an abundance of pretty flower-bedecked chalets, little shops and cafés that line the streets. In the evenings, you can experience folklore events and traditional Swiss music.</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>Head to Lauterbrunnen, where you can discover the museum of local history, geology, and mountaineering. Or, venture further to the Jungfraujoch, where you can pass through the multimedia experience tour, taking you back through the history of over 100 years of the Jungfrau railway.</p>
<h3>Excellent transport network</h3>
<p>Aerial cableways and mountain railways means access to nearby towns and villages like Stechelberg and Gimmelwald is super easy, you even get discounted rates with your included Swiss Half Fare Card. Or, reach peaks and hiking areas like the Schilthorn and Grütschalp, or go back down to Lauterbrunnen and beyond.</p>
<p>During summer 2024, a new cable car to Schilthorn is under construction - the current cable car is still in use, but a few of the viewing platforms at Schilthorn and Birg may be closed.</p>
<h3>Nearby villages and days out</h3>
<p>There's a huge choice of excursions within the region, including visits to the Jungfraujoch, the alpine gardens at Schynige Platte, and the nearby Trümmelbach Waterfalls. As you head down to the valley, stop in Gimmelwald to explore the historic sawmill, cattle and cheese farms. Did you know Gimmelwald has a little unstaffed shop?</p>
<h3>A variety of walks</h3>
<p>Mountains, meadows, and forests provide walkers with everything from scenic strolls to adventurous hikes. Take a stroll on the flower trail at the Allmendhubel, or complete the Northface Trail, a moderate circular walk from the Schilthornbahn to Spilboden.</p>
<h3>Adrenaline activities</h3>
<p>The Jungfrau region has plenty for the adventure-seekers - first up, the Thrill Walk at Birg is a must-do. Metal walkways cling to the cliff beneath the lift station offering many a perfect photo opportunity. If you've got a really good head for heights, and previous via ferrata experience, the K3 via ferrata in Mürren is said to be one of the best in Switzerland. Or, head to Wengen for a unique "Royal Ride" on the open air Männlichen cable car. Over in Grindelwald, there's more adventure to be had, with a Cliff Walk, zip line, mountain carting and more.</p>
<h3>Sports centre</h3>
<p>Make your way to Alpines Sportzentrum Mürren for a gym and swim session. Or, sit back and relax in the new spa area with two different saunas, plunge pool, relaxation room and Turkish steam bath. If you're in need of a deeper unwind, book treatments too, like a hot stone massage.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
<p>Spend part of your day competing on the courts. Sportchalet Mürren has four outdoor sand courts which can be individually hired. We can't forget to mention the incredible views of the Lauterbrunnen Valley that comes with them.</p>
<h3>Mountain dining</h3>
<p>From mountain huts to alpine restaurants, or simple cafés and bars – you will not go hungry here. The popular Winteregg restaurant has a sun terrace, perfect for a refreshing Rivella – Switzerland's favourite soft drink. You will also love the revolving restaurant up the Schilthorn, serving an incredible James Bond brunch.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>
