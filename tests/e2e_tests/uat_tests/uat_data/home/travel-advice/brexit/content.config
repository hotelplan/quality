<p><strong>As of the 1st January 2021, the UK has left the EU. Here’s what you need to know before travelling with us in 2021:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passports:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll need to ensure that you have at least six months validity left on your passport when returning from EU countries. You may also be required to provide evidence of your return ticket and that you have enough currency for your holiday when arriving in your destination. For more advice on entry requirements, please<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" target="_blank"> visit the Government website.</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Travel Disruption:</strong> When entering and exiting countries, it is your responsibilty to give yourself extra time to get through the immigration queues in the airports as there will be delays. We may have to organise our transfers slightly to help with this and ensure that you have extra time.</p>
<p><strong>Driving in the EU: </strong>From 28 September UK stickers will replace GB stickers. Check the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers" target="_blank">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK before, on or after 28 September 2021.</p>
<p>If you are hiring a car, ensure you have a green card. In both cases you must make sure that you have the relevant international driving insurance with your chosen provider.</p>
<p><strong>EHIC Cards and Travel Insurance:</strong> Under a new agreement with the EU, UK residents are now able to apply for a UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) if your current European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) has expired. This will give you access to emergency and medically necessary healthcare in the EU during your holiday. You can still use your EHIC card, excluding Switzerland and Norway,  if it is still valid and in date and as part of our terms and conditions, you must also still hold valid travel insurance to cover your personal circumstances, (pre-existing conditions, etc). In Norway, you can show your UK Passport to receive limited urgent healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Data Roaming:</strong> Free data roaming will cease, therefore you need to be aware of any additional charges for using your phone and data abroad. Most of our properties have complimentary Wi-Fi for guests to use, but please remember that this is for social usage only.</p>
<p><strong>ATOL &amp; ABTA:</strong> As we are an ATOL and ABTA bonded UK travel company, guests booking with us enjoy comprehensive consumer protection. Your holiday will be protected under the Package Travel Regulations, which means you have the right to a full refund if, for any reason, we can no longer provide your holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Visas:</strong> From 2024, all UK citizens will need to register for an <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://etias.com/" target="_blank">ETIAS</a> (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) visa-waiver. The cost will be around €7 and the visa-waiver will be valid for a three year period.</p>
<p>The UK government and ABTA have also put together some useful information about holidaying in the EU. These resources can be found below:</p>
