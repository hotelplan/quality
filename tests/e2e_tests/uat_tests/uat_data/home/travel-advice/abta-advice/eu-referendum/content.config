  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We appreciate that our guests who are travelling soon and those who are considering booking a holiday will have concerns over how our exit from the EU will affect their travel plans. Please find below ABTA's official statement on the EU Referendum result and a link to their Q&amp;As to answer any questions you have.</p>
<p><strong>ABTA Official Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister has stated that there will be no initial change in the way people travel. Travellers are as free to move between the UK and the EU as they were yesterday, European Health Insurance cards remain valid and regulations such as Air Passenger Rights remain in place. People due to travel this summer will see little changes to their holiday. Once the UK formally notifies the EU of its intention to leave, the remaining Member States will have up to two years to offer the UK a deal for a future trading relationship and during this period holidaymakers will not see any immediate changes.</p>
