<p>On Monday 23rd September 2019, Thomas Cook formally ceased trading. If you are an Inghams guest booked on a Thomas Cook flight or have booked an Inghams holiday via Thomas Cook, please read the below information carefully. This page will be updated as new information becomes available, so please check back regularly.</p>
<p>For guests who have already emailed us, no further action is required unless we contact you asking for any more information.</p>
<p><strong>For guests currently on holiday with us, who booked via a Thomas Cook store:</strong></p>
<p>Your holiday will be taking place as originally planned. Your inbound flight will operate as usual.</p>
<p><strong>For guests yet to travel and booked on a Thomas Cook flight:</strong></p>
<p>We are making every effort to arrange alternative flights, and will contact you as soon as we have details of what has been organised for you, or to discuss options if no appropriate replacement flight is available. If you have not already been contacted, for now, please sit tight and as soon as we have an update, we will of course contact you.</p>
<p><strong>For all guests on an Inghams holiday booked via a Thomas Cook store:</strong></p>
<p>Please be assured that your booking is safe. We will be taking it over directly, and all further correspondence and information will be provided by us. We have recently received contact details previously held by Thomas Cook for any guest booked on an Inghams holiday. Over the next few weeks we will be amending bookings on our system so that we hold your details within our database. Once the booking has been moved over, you will receive a new invoice and booking reference number. Please make sure that when you receive this, you check all the holiday details are correct, especially that the first and last name on the booking match your passport (middle names not required).</p>
<p>Inghams will be supplying you with the package holiday and everything that’s included will appear on your invoice. Please be aware that if you booked extras with Thomas Cook which we do not supply, or offer, such as but not limited to, airport parking, meet and greet service or insurance, you will need to contact the supplier to see if these are still valid. If not, you will need to claim the cost of these extras from the CAA. More information is available by visiting; <a rel="noopener" href="https://thomascook.caa.co.uk/customers/if-you-have-a-future-booking-and-have-not-travelled-yet/" target="_blank">https://thomascook.caa.co.uk/customers/if-you-have-a-future-booking-and-have-not-travelled-yet/</a></p>
<p>If you have booked extras such as excursion or ski packs for winter bookings, please make sure these appear on your new invoice. Some agents may have booked these directly with the supplier, in which case you will need to contact the supplier directly to see if these are still valid. We do not have access to information about anything booked outside of our package, so will not have contact details for these suppliers. If you want to book extras such as excursion or ski packs, please see our website for further details of what is available.</p>
<p>We politely ask that you do not contact us to request updates, as this will only slow the rebooking process. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>Please also be aware that we have been alerted to fraudsters contacting former Thomas Cook customers requesting their credit card number and 3-digit security code to process a refund. Please be vigilant and ignore any such calls.</p>
