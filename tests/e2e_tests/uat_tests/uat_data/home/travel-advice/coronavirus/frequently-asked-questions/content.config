  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We’re frequently reviewing the information contained on this page and are committed to ensuring that the safety of our guests is our first priority. The information and policies that follow were made in good faith and correct at the time of publication. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the Coronavirus pandemic, we may need to change or update the policies outlined below at short notice and in line with new developments, relevant guidance and legal obligations.</p>
<p>The safety of our guests is our utmost priority and as a responsible tour operator, we will continue to only travel to destinations where it is safe to do so as advised by the Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO).</p>
<p>All our holidays are subject to the local Covid-19 regulations of the destination country, which may differ from that of the UK. We recommend you are familiar with these before you travel – you can find more information in our country/resort <a data-udi="umb://document/504132b8d7ab4765a76479fc557c5cb4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/504132b8d7ab4765a76479fc557c5cb4}#TravelAdviceperCountry" title="Entry Requirements" data-anchor="#TravelAdviceperCountry">Entry Requirements Table</a>.</p>
<p>If the guidance changes for the destination you are due to travel to, and this has an effect on our ability to provide your holiday, we will be in contact as soon as we can to talk through your options.</p>
<p>We understand that the current situation may be unsettling and we would like to reassure you and remind you of the <a data-udi="umb://document/fa72be9e45bc442089252c6a18a0d2ae" href="/{localLink:umb://document/fa72be9e45bc442089252c6a18a0d2ae}" title="In Safe Hands">extra measures we’ve put in place to help keep you and your money safe</a>.</p>

<p style="color: #003155;"><strong>Will I be entitled to a refund if Inghams has to cancel or make a significant change to my holiday due to the Coronavirus outbreak?</strong></p>
<p>If things change and we have to cancel your holiday because of Coronavirus, you can move your holiday to another available date or destination of equivalent value, or pay the difference to upgrade your trip. If for any reason you are not able to move your holiday, we’ll give you a refund.</p>
<p>Equally, if we have to make a significant change to your holiday, we’ll give you the option of accepting the change or receiving a refund. You can find out more about what would be considered a significant change in our <a data-udi="umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821}" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">booking terms &amp; conditions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please remember it is a condition of our booking terms that you have valid travel insurance. We would strongly recommend that you take travel insurance out at the time of booking that offers additional Coronavirus cover.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our insurance partner Campbell Irvine offer travel insurance with additional comprehensive Covid-19 cover and will be happy to give you a quote.

<p style="color: #003155;"><strong>I am due to go on holiday with Inghams. Can I get a refund if I choose to cancel my holiday?</strong></p>
<p>We are confident that our future holidays will be going ahead as planned. If we are able to operate your holiday and you choose to cancel your booking, we will not be able to offer a refund on your holiday or added extras and our usual <a data-udi="umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821}" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">cancellation terms</a> apply. <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find further information, FAQs and travel updates about your planned holiday by visiting our <a data-udi="umb://document/102583bcb28e4f5cab9feab03098d4a8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/102583bcb28e4f5cab9feab03098d4a8}" title="Ski Hub">Ski</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/2f46f1a421fe4203a3502584fa80d1c0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2f46f1a421fe4203a3502584fa80d1c0}" title="Summer Hub">Summer</a> specific COVID Hubs.</span></p>
<p>Equally, if we make the decision to suspend your holiday to a given destination and you cancelled before we took that action, we will not offer a refund retrospectively. You should therefore ensure that you have adequate travel insurance and seek to recover cancellation charges from your insurer where possible.</p>
<p>If you have underlying health concerns, we would recommend that you speak to your GP and travel insurer, who may offer a degree of cover for cancellation on these grounds, subject to the terms of your policy, and you may need a note from your GP to support your claim.</p>
