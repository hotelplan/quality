<p>On Monday 2nd October, Monarch Airlines formally ceased trading. If you are an Inghams guest booked on a Monarch flight, please read the below information carefully. This page will be updated as new information becomes available, so please check back regularly.</p>
<p>For guests currently on holiday in resort, and booked to fly home on a Monarch flight:</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Authority is making arrangements to return all holidaymakers home as quickly as possible at the end of their holidays. Your Inghams Representative will be in touch as soon as further details are available regarding arrangements for your homeward journey. More information is also available on the CAA website: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://monarch.caa.co.uk/customers/i-am-currently-abroad/" target="_blank">https://monarch.caa.co.uk/customers/i-am-currently-abroad/</a></p>
<p><strong>For guests who are departing the UK on a non-Monarch flight, and were scheduled to return before the 15th October on a Monarch flight:</strong></p>
<p>Your holiday will be taking place as originally planned. Your outbound flight will operate as usual, and the CAA will make arrangements to return you at the end of your holiday with a replacement flight.</p>
<p>For all other guests booked to travel on a Monarch flight either outbound, homebound or both, in October 2017:</p>
<p>We are making every effort to re-arrange alternative flights for you, and will contact you as soon as we have details of what has been organised for you, or to discuss options if no appropriate replacement flight is available.</p>
<p><strong>For all guests booked to travel on a Monarch flight in November 2017 or later:</strong></p>
<p>We are currently in the process of rearranging all flights that are affected, and will be providing you with your new flight details as soon as they are available. As a responsible tour operator, please be assured that your holiday with Inghams is entirely protected. As soon as we have details of your new flights, we will of course be in touch. In the meantime, please do bear with us as we make these arrangements. As we are sure you can appreciate, demand for replacement flights will be high and rebooking may take some time.</p>
<p>We expect to be able to provide you with updated flight details in the next 14 days. In the meantime we ask that you do not contact us to request updates, as this will only slow the rebooking process. Thank you for your patience.</p>
