<p><span>What a start to the year it’s been. The UK government has slowly been easing its rules on Covid-19 testing for fully vaccinated travellers returning home, and many of our holiday destinations are gradually reducing their restrictions. This is a huge positive step for travel, and many of you are grasping the opportunity to get back to the mountains on your long awaited ski holiday.</span><br /><br /><span>But alongside sharing my optimism for the future, I wanted to take this opportunity to apologise for where we have fallen short of our promise to you. Over these last few months many of you have experienced long delays in getting through to us, by phone and on email, and for this I am truly sorry. We pride ourselves on our expert knowledge and personal touch, which makes it all the more disappointing when we can’t live up to this.  </span><br /><br /><span>Whilst we always prepare for a busy winter period, the frequent and often complex changes to travel regulations across Europe, combined with covid-related staffing challenges, have been far greater than we anticipated, and at times, unrelenting. This has given us challenges in all departments. Our team have been working hard to give customers as much flexibility as possible when assisting with their holiday bookings. However the long wait times you may have experienced, means we haven’t delivered our usual high levels of service. For this I apologise.</span><br /><br /><span>I’d like to give you my personal assurance that we’re doing everything we can to respond to customers as quickly as possible. As well as increasing our efforts to recruit more sales and service advisors, we’ve drafted in help from every department around the business (including our overseas resort teams) to create more open channels of communication across live web chat, social media, email and phone.</span><br /><br /><span>We’ve also invested in our website, creating a new </span><strong>Covid-19 Information Hub</strong> for any Covid-19 travel queries, with live feeds for the latest travel entry requirements and our overseas teams updating the latest information and requirements for in resort.  In the future we’re also looking to enhance our digital self-serve booking tools to assist customers wishing to view and update their holiday with us online.<br /><br />The call wait times have now reduced significantly, and continue to improve. If you are still trying to reach us with questions about the latest Covid-19 travel regulations and what this means for your holiday, we have a dedicated email address and phone number - email <a href="mailto:traveladvice@inghams.co.uk"><strong>traveladvice@inghams.co.uk</strong></a> or call us on <strong>01252 282 480</strong>. Customers with an upcoming ski holiday can also speak with their Overseas Resort representative directly via the email included in their welcome pack (found via the <a rel="noopener" name="Hyperlink_20220203_140440632" href="http://links.email.inghams.co.uk/els/v2/R9~pQrg6AWQK/SVRMU3RDNjRTdW56aEgzNm80N1BuakVmTlZnaTBWM3NOYkpDa1l4VTJhSnZxNUE0dnh4OG45aW9xOXdPdlRydmVtUzlQakhvUmtuSWljSE1CcnkvaFh6ZnE2NlVjQ1hZTWR0NHpMOE1IaWc9S0/" target="_blank"><strong>‘my booking’</strong></a> portal).<br /><br />May I end by thanking you for your continued patience and understanding,<br /><strong><br /><br /><img src="http://contentz.mkt941.com/ra/2022/32246/02/71198219/Joe%20Ponte%20Signature.jpg" border="0" alt="joe-ponte-signature" width="140" /><br />Joe Ponte<br />Hotelplan UK, CEO</strong></p>]]></bodyText>
