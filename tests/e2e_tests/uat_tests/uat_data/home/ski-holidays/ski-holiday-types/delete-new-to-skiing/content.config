<p><strong>Booking your first skiing holiday can be complicated enough. Where to go? Which resort is best? What to take? What will it all cost? And probably above all, will I enjoy it?</strong></p>
<br />
<p>The answer to that last question is the easy bit – yes, you’ll love it! But to make life simpler on the rest, see opposite for our ‘Beginners Top 6’. All of them combine the key ingredients for a successful first holiday - great snow, first-class ski instructors, plenty of après-ski of course, and outstanding value for money. Our Reservations Team know all the resorts and hotels inside out to help with any questions you may have, and then our Resort Representatives will take over and be on hand all week, to help you enjoy your holiday to the full!</p>

<td><strong>Choose your resort carefully.</strong> The big-name resorts may not be the best choice, so check out our ‘Top 6’ for some ideas.</td>
<td><strong>But forget the designer ski gear</strong> - it’s expensive and won’t make you ski any better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pre-book everything before you go.</strong> You’ll save money, time and stress by getting your instructor, liftpass and equipment all lined up in advance, so our Resort Reps have everything ready for you on arrival.</td>
<td><strong>Invest in a few classes before your holiday.</strong> An hour or two at a UK indoor ski slope will certainly give you a head start, and just some basic fitness effort at your local gym will help avoid aching muscles. (See our Skiplex offer)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Don’t skimp</strong> on good quality sunglasses, suncream, gloves and socks. Warm hands and feet are the key to enjoying the snow!</td>

<p style="color: #023761; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Inghams Beginners Top 6</p>
<p>Most resorts in our brochure have dedicated beginners’ ski lifts and slopes, and all have ski-schools. But some places really go ‘the extra mile’ to welcome newcomers to wintersports, and it is these that we especially recommend here, with full details of what’s included in the chart below.</p>

Brought in new this year specifically with beginners in mind, it offers super-short airport transfers, ideal beginners’ slopes, friendly and welcoming ski instructors, and amazing value Ski-Inclusive offers.</td>
<td><a data-udi="umb://document/71c7bd573f214a32ada6ee90c9f2d269" href="/{localLink:umb://document/71c7bd573f214a32ada6ee90c9f2d269}" title="Kranjska Gora"><strong>KRANJSKA GORA, SLOVENIA</strong></a> Great value prices both on the mountain and in resort, combined with a first-class ski-school and mainly easy skiing, make Slovenia an excellent choice. With the majestic Julian Alps as a background, you’ll quickly find your ski legs, and be off exploring the mountain.</td>

The ‘Happy Card’ lift-ticket (from approx. £11) means you only pay for the ski-lifts as you use them, which is a tremendous saving for your first days on the snow.</td>

Wide, gentle slopes start right in the village itself, and you’ll soon progress to the longer runs down to neighbouring Les Gets.</td>
