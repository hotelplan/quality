<p>Explore the slopes of one of Switzerland’s top resorts, Verbier, with Ski Sunday presenter and ex pro snowboarder Ed Leigh.</p>
<p>Ever fancied a chance to ride with an ex-pro snowboarder and host of the BBC favourite Ski Sunday? Well now you can! Teaming up with the Telegraph, Inghams are offering an exclusive ski weekend break to <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4}" title="Verbier">Verbier</a></strong> in <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/52fab17731fa49639f8a0841e064a064" href="/{localLink:umb://document/52fab17731fa49639f8a0841e064a064}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a></strong>, where guests will have the chance to ski/snowboard with the snowboarding legend himself (for a minimum of 2 half days) as well as members of the Telegraph Ski and Snowboard team. When not tearing it up on the slopes, Ed and the team on hand know Verbier inside and out; for them it is a second home (for the season at least!) and know all the best nightlife and après ski haunts.</p>
<p>What can we say about <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4}" title="Verbier">Verbier</a></strong>? A haven for those with a little more ski experience up their sleeves, <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0f5a0d90fe3493faa137de4bb419db4}" title="Verbier">Verbier</a></strong> is renowned for its off-piste riding, deep powder, extensive mogul fields, terrain park, and has become, over the years, something of an iconic resort. A tremendously popular destination for British skiers and snowboarders (affectionately known as The Brits), it attracts a fun crowd of sports people who enjoy their après ski drinks as much as their treasured time on the slopes. The ski area is serviced by a quick, modern and efficient lift system which allows you to make the most of the short amount of time that you have away.</p>
