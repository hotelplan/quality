  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><em><span class="location-text geolocation-title">1. Respect others</span> </em><br />Don’t prejudice against other skiers or boarders on the mountain and do not behave in such a way that might endanger others.</p>
<p><em><span class="location-text geolocation-title">2. Control your speed</span></em> <br />Know your ability and always stay in control of your speed and balance so that you can stop and avoid other people or objects. If you are not sure about your ability then perhaps take some lessons with a qualified instructor to increase your confidence.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">3. The right of way</span> </em><br />It’s an age old argument that echoes off the mountains following a tumble... Regardless of who cut who off, the rule of the thumb is that those who are below you on the slope have the right of way. Choose your route accordingly and judge your speed so that you do not endanger them.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">4. Over taking</span></em><br />Leave plenty of space when you are over taking another skier or snowboarder so that if the overtaken person makes any unpredictable movements, no-one is likely to have a crash.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">5. Merging</span> </em><br />If your piste is about to merge with another piste, or you are about to set off again from a stand-still position, always look UP the slope to check for any oncoming ski traffic to avoid endangering yourself and others.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">6. Stopping on the piste.</span> </em><br />Try to avoid this unless absolutely necessary. If you must stop, do so in a safe location at the side of the piste where you can clearly be seen from above.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">7. Climbing or descending on foot</span></em> <br />Keep to a safe side of the piste when climbing or descending on foot and make sure that you are clearly visible at all times.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">8. Respect signs and markings</span> </em><br />Pay attention to all given signs, markings and warnings that are dotted around the resort. These can warn you about potential closed areas, avalanche likelihood and whether the weather is about to turn.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">9. Assistance</span> </em><br />If you witness an accident- help. It is every skier and snowboarders duty to make sure that the injured person is given the correct medical attention. Carry a charged mobile phone and call the ski patrol if necessary.</p>
<p><em><span class="geolocation-title">10. Identification</span></em> <br />For insurance purposes, anyone involved in an accident (witness or otherwise) that escalates must exchange details.</p>]]></bodyText>
