  <description><![CDATA[<p>The modern and stylish Pointe Isabelle has a great location in Chamonix. Having been in the same family for many years you are sure to get a warm welcome. After a day on the slopes you can relax in the sauna with panoramic views or stay active in the fitness room.</p>
<h2>Central location</h2>
<p>The fantastic location in the centre of <a data-udi="umb://document/6d1f6b40d62d48a6acbcf99f87501ea0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6d1f6b40d62d48a6acbcf99f87501ea0}" title="Chamonix">Chamonix</a> will appeal to both keen skiers and those interested in the culture and activities of Chamonix. The sunny terrace adjoining the bar is one of Chamonix’s favourite spots for enjoying the mountain scenery and soaking up the resort atmosphere. The trendy bar/bistro is the perfect place to relax in the evening and have dinner, offering traditional fare with a modern twist and some British and Scandinavian favourites. </p>
<p>This hotel has plenty of history behind it. The hotel is named after a British lady, Isabella Straton, who broke boundaries exploring the Alps in the Victorian era with her husband who was a local guide. Her grandchildren opened this hotel and named it the Pointe Isabelle (3,761m) after the mountain that she first climbed back in January 1861. </p>
<h2>Modern and comfortable </h2>
<p>The rooms at the Pointe Isabelle will offer you a comfortable place to stay, the rooms have been refurbished in recent years and have been finished to a high standard. The interior design was led by a Scandinavian designer but keeping the style and telling the story of Isabella Straton but in a modern and contemporary style. Most of the rooms have wonderful views over Chamonix and the surrounding mountain peaks, so you can sit back and relax after a day of skiing.</p>
<p>When the hotel added an extension in 2019, a wonderful sauna and fitness room had been added. Sit back and relax in the sauna with panoramic views over the resort, which is great for relieving your achy ski legs after a day on the slopes. For the more active guests, make the most of the fitness room with modern equipment. </p>
