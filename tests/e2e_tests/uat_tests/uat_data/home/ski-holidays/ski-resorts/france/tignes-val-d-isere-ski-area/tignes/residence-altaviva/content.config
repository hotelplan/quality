  <description><![CDATA[<p>Residence Altaviva is ideally located in Tignes 1800, right on a blue slope and just a few minutes walk from the resort centre. The residence is ski in, ski out with access to the <a data-udi="umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565" href="/{localLink:umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565}" title="Tignes">Tignes - Val d'Isère</a> area which extends over 300km and offers 156 ski runs. There's nowhere quite like it!</p>
<h2>Unforgettable scenery</h2>
<p>Protected by the woodland and rocks, the L'Altaviva Residence offers a landscape you won't want to miss. These tastefully decorated apartments and the large south-facing terrace - used by the restaurant and swimming pool - all have views overlooking the ski slopes and we're sure you'll fall in love with the panoramic views of the surrounding mountains.</p>
<h2>Family favourite  </h2>
<p>The residence is perfect if you're all looking to spend quality time together in the comfort of your own space. Alternatively, there are many opportunities for you and the family to socialise and make friends - make the most of the children's clubs and communal areas like the lounge or swimming pool. Tignes 1800 attracts families back time and time again to the resort offering varied slopes and all the facilities you could wish for.</p>
<h2>Soothing spa and relaxation facilities </h2>
<p>Escape from the slopes and enjoy a moment of relaxation in the attractive spa area. The Ô Pure Spa is very spacious with an aqua relaxation area featuring a pool, whirlpool, hammam and sauna - there is an entrance fee, however it is well worth it for a moment of peace and quite. There are also treatment rooms and massages available at an extra cost if you feel like really treating yourself.</p>]]></description>
