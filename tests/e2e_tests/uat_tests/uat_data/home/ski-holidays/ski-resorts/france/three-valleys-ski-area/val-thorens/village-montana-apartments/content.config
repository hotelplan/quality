  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Village Montana is made up of three residences, Montana Premier and Valbel both located on the piste and Montana Soleil is just over the road, so all of the apartments are conveniently positioned. The apartments are spacious, comfortable and all have superb views across <a data-udi="umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8}" title="Val Thorens">Val Thorens</a>. The resort centre is accessed by a lift and a covered walkway, plus you can enjoy how convenient the complex is with on-site restaurants, bar, lounge, sun terrace and gift shop. There is also a bakery delivery service, taking the fuss out of breakfast (pay locally).</p>
