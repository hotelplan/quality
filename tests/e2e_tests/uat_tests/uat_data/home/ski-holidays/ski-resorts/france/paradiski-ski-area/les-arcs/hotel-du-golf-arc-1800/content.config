  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hotel du Golf offers great value for money as its on an all-inclusive basis, including all meals and drinks. Located at the base of the nursery slopes and pistes, the hotel enjoys a prime location in Arc 1800, providing easy access to the <a data-udi="umb://document/37e8bc9846b74cf1a001f969874ce05b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/37e8bc9846b74cf1a001f969874ce05b}" title="Paradiski Ski Area">Paradiski Ski Area</a>. The Du Golf is a fantastic option for families, groups, and couples due to its great facilities, friendly and laid-back attitude, and popular restaurants. After an active day on the slopes, the bar and lounge area with a large fireplace makes a cosy and welcoming space to unwind, often with live music.</p>
<h2>All inclusive</h2>
<p>The Hotel du Golf, which is now all inclusive, offers outstanding value for money. All meals are included for the duration of your stay; fuel up for a day on the slopes with a extensive buffet breakfast, then return for a buffet style lunch or arrange a piste picnic for an additional cost. If you're feeling peckish after a day on the slopes, there are a range of snacks available to keep you going until dinner. Each evening, you can enjoy a three-course buffet-style meal with a range of salads, hot dishes, desserts, and cheese; also a classic French fondue, raclette, or tartiflette meal is available, you can reserve your seat at the Le Mont Blanc restaurant upon arrival. If you want to treat yourself to a meal out, the à la carte Petit Zinc restaurant, which serves brasserie-style Italian meals (pay locally), is a excellent option. Beers, cocktails, soft drinks, wine by the glass, and hot beverages are also included.</p>
<h2>Excellent location</h2>
<p>Located at the foot of the pistes, the Hotel Du Golf is a great choice for keen skiers and boarders who want to explore the extensive Paradiski slopes. The nursery slopes are nearby, so beginners can easily start their day on gentle slopes closer to home. The close proximity to the fun MILLE8 activity ski area and aquatic centre adds to its appeal, especially for families - if its a bit too snowy to ski the MILLE8 features a swimming pool, wellness area, and fitness room.  </p>
<h2>Relax and unwind</h2>
<p>After a day on the mountain the hotel features its own wellness area including an indoor heated plunge pool, whirlpool, steam room and sauna (pay locally). There is also a cosy lounge and bar area, perfect for catching up with family and friends after a day on the slopes.</p>]]></description>
