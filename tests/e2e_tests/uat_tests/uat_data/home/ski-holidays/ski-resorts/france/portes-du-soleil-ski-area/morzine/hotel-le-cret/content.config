The centre of Morzine is just a short walk away, and you can get onto the fabulous slopes of the Portes du Soleil in less than ten minutes. When you return from a day on the slopes make the most of the wellness area and cosy bar. </p>

Unwind after exploring the mountain in the Turkish bath, have a dip in the indoor swimming pool or relax in the sauna. Treat yourself to a beauty or body treatment for an additional fee to fully relax and unwind. For the active guests, there is a fitness room available with modern equipment and views of the surrounding mountains. If the spa isn't for you, have a drink in the comfortable lounge and bar area or make the most of the winter sun on the outdoor terrace. </p>
