  <description><![CDATA[<p>The family-run Hotel Chalet Mounier was one of the first hotels to be built in <a data-udi="umb://document/94b0461bf3c0472a89c38df58692ce28" href="/{localLink:umb://document/94b0461bf3c0472a89c38df58692ce28}" title="Les 2 Alpes">Les 2 Alpes </a>and it has been smartly modernised yet still retains a character of its own. You will be immediately won over by the charm of the place with its cosy lounges, the excellent leisure facilities, the savoury aromas and reputation for food and the exceptional hospitality of the Mounier family. To promote sustainable tourism, Chalet Mounier has renewed its 'Green Key' label, an international benchmark for environmental responsibility and sustainable tourism operations. This coveted award reflects businesses commitment to adhering to the Foundation for Environmental Education's criteria.</p>
<p>During the day there is a complimentary hotel shuttle service to and from the lifts, alternatively the Diable chair lift is a 5 minutes' walk away and the ski school meeting point and Jandri Express are a 10 minutes' walk.</p>
<h2>Family run</h2>
<p>The story of  Le Chalet Mounier began in 1879 with the construction of a farmhouse inn. The Mounier family converted the inn into a hotel in 1933, and since then it has run by generations of the family. They have managed to keep all of the inn's historic charm intact, providing guests with a peaceful retreat in the <a data-udi="umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5}" title="France">French Alps</a>. With a cosy lounge and welcoming bar, delicious gourmet restaurant, luxury spa and conveniently located by the ski slopes, this hotel ticks all the boxes for a winter getaway</p>
<div class="texteType1 ouvert">
<h2>Food and drink</h2>
<p>The Chalet Mounier has two restaurants, where their focus on sustainability stands out, so you are spoilt for choice.  Half board meals are served in the chic Le Chalet Mounier restaurant - the three course dinner menu is inspired by the Michelin-starred Le P'tit Polyte's cuisine, the dishes feature a blend of authentic tastes and creativity, featuring fresh, local and in-season produce. Alternatively, enjoy an amazing culinary experience at Le P'tit Polyte for a special occasion or a holiday treat (pay locally). Serving inventive and astounding cuisine, Le P'tit Polyte is the highest altitude Michelin-starred restaurant in the Isère area. To find the perfect accompaniment for your meal, a extensive wine menu with a selection of over 500 wines is available.</p>
<h2><span>Cinq Mondes Spa</span></h2>
<p><span>There's no better place to unwind after a day of skiing on Les 2 Alpes than the hotel's spa, which is accessible to both visitors and Cinq Mondes Spa customers. Make use of the sauna and steam room's healing properties, relax in the jacuzzi, or go for a swim in the indoor pool. For an extra treat, you can book a variety of massages and beauty treatments locally. With a variety of equipment in the fitness area, you can stay active - even off the slopes.<br /><br /></span></p>
