<li>Transfer time approx. 30 minutes from Innsbruck Airport</li>
<li>Skiing to 2,100 metres</li>
</ul>
<p>Seefeld is an exceptional, all-round destination for a winter break. Enjoyable, laid-back skiing in alpine terrain at 1200m above sea level with spacious pistes and state-of-the-art lift facilities. Seefeld’s place in the history of skiing was assured when local ski instructor, and two-time World Championship slalom winner, Toni Seelos invented the parallel turn. </p>
<h2>Skiing and snowboarding in Seefeld </h2>
<p>Seefeld has played a historic part in the development of downhill skiing and is a great resort for groups of mixed abilities. Renowned for having one of the best ski schools in Austria, it is a fantastic place to learn to ski, or simply perfect your technique, and with the wealth of blue runs across the ski area, this an excellent destination for beginners. The ski area is split into three areas - f<span>or newbies, the Geigenbühel area near the centre of the village provides an ideal and unintimidating place learn. Intermediates will enjoy the Gschwandtkopf area, with wide and well groomed south facing slopes. </span><span>And for those of you who'd like a real challenge, the higher and longer runs of the Rosshütte and the Härmelekopf area offer some exciting runs for you to plough down.</span></p>
<p>The extensive cross-country trails through this resort are absolutely gorgeous, and offer fantastic mountain scenery. The cross-country skiing in Seefeld is possibly the best <a data-udi="umb://document/7cc7c659d5214aa9b4d7bed936a721bb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7cc7c659d5214aa9b4d7bed936a721bb}" title="Austria">Austria</a> has to offer. Leutasch is the central hub for cross country skiers and offers kilometres of trails for you to explore.

<h2>Bars and restaurants in Seefeld</h2>
<p>Seefeld has a variety of restaurants that serve warm and hearty traditional Austrian dishes - and what better way to end a day skiing then eating some delicious mountain cuisine? One of our personal favourites is the Südtiroler Stube, located in the heart of the village near the village square. Serving sophisticated Tirolean cuisine in classic Stube surroundings, the restaurant has a delightful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Après is definitely a possibility here, and Seefeld has an excellent range of bars.

  <generalInformation><![CDATA[<h3 style="color: #003155;">Beginners skiing and snowboarding in Seefeld</h3>
<p>There are few better places to learn to ski and snowboard than on the gentle slopes right in the centre of the village. With help from the friendly, English-speaking ski instructors, beginner skiers and snowboarders progress quickly. The ski schools begin on a Monday and meet in the Geigenbulle ski area. With short, simple blue runs all accessed by drag lifts and magic carpets, this is a perfect area from which to develop your skiing and snowboarding skills.</p>
<h3 style="color: #003155;">Ski schools in Seefeld</h3>
<p>In Seefeld, you can learn from the pros and take advantage of range of tuition on offer. Thanks to the amazing beginner areas partnered with the great instructors on hand, there is no better place to learn. The ski schools are located along the sunny plateau and offer great views as well as easy slopes.</p>
<p>No matter your age or your skill level, there are opportunities to learn and refine your skills on the mountain.</p>
<h3 style="color: #003155;">Intermediates skiing and snowboarding in Seefeld</h3>
<p>Typified by wide, open blue and red runs, on-piste cruising in Seefeld is a fantastic experience. Those who have taken a break from skiing for a year or two will enjoy the area around Gschwandtkopf with its wealth of blue runs. More accomplished skiers will find exhilarating runs on the Rosshütte side of the valley where the cable cars and lifts take you higher up the mountain. We recommend going to the top of the, Seefelder Joch and the Härmelekopf.</p>
<h3 style="color: #003155;">Advanced skiing and snowboarding in Seefeld</h3>
<p>Advanced skiers and ambitious intermediates may find the on-piste terrain a little limited compared with more dedicated downhill resorts. That being said, there are a couple of short black runs on the Rosshütte side of Seefeld. And for free riders there is a challenging off-piste area above the Härmelekopf cable car. We strongly recommend an experienced mountain guide if you plan to leave the safety of the pistes.</p>
<h3 style="color: #003155;">Off piste and snow parks in Seefeld</h3>
<p>Seefeld is not a popular area for freeriding and the off-piste options can be limiting. However, advanced skiers and boarders will enjoy the testing run down the back side of Harmelekopf - be aware that this should only be attempted with a guide. </p>
<p>Seefeld provides access to a couple of areas where you can really show off your skills. The snow park located in Gschwandtkopf is a small but nice park with some jumps and obstacles for freestyle beginners. Rosshute is the largest ski area in Seefeld and provides access to a fantastic snow park equipped with half pipes and jumps.</p>
<h3 style="color: #003155;">Cross-country skiing in Seefeld</h3>
<p>With 279km of trails the Seefeld plateau is a cross-country paradise. It is Austria’s leading resort for cross-country skiing and one of Europe’s largest cross-country ski areas.  Seefeld has consistently hosted international cross-country or Nordic skiing competitions, twice hosting the Nordic skiing disciplines at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The extensive cross-country ski trails, which are divided into classic trails (154km) and skating trails (125km) link five villages throughout the valley: Seefeld, Leutasch, Mösern, Reith and Scharnitz; and range across altitudes of 1180m – 1550m. Many of the trails start from the beautiful Seekirchl chapel and are suitable for all levels, with a variety of routes graded as easy, medium and difficult.</p>
<p>Cross-country skiers will appreciate the fact that there is no need for a lift pass to enjoy cross-country skiing. There is a one-off fixed cost to use the trails for an unlimited duration – all you need to do is purchase a Seefeld Guest Card from the tourist office in resort.</p>
<p>If you’ve never taken a cross-country ski holiday before but would like to ‘give it a go’ then Seefeld is the perfect destination to learn. Specialised cross country ski schools can be found locally. And the technique takes no time to pick up, especially for those familiar with downhill skiing. You’ll be able to explore snow-dusted pine forests and open areas of beauty at a gentle pace while spotting wildlife in the snow. What a wonderful way to spend time in a winter wonderland.</p>]]></generalInformation>

<h3><strong>Restaurants</strong>,<strong> food and drink</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone familiar with Austrian food will be well aware of how hearty and full of flavour it can be – a perfect accompaniment to a day spent skiing. Seefeld has a wealth of restaurants serving the full range of delicious, traditional Austrian dishes. One of our personal favourites is the Südtiroler Stube, located in the heart of the village near the village square. Serving sophisticated Tirolean cuisine in classic Stube surroundings, the restaurant has a delightful atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Wildmoos Alm is an on-the-mountain favorite, famous for its strudel trolley and charming and friendly staff. It is a must visit for many regular guests to Seefeld and popular with us for its range of schnapps and strudel. We also recommend the Sportalm at the bottom of Gschwandkopft, well known for its chicken and chips in a basket.</p>
<h3><strong>Aprés, bars, clubs, and nightlife</strong></h3>
<p>Seefeld has an excellent range of bars for the aprés connoisseurs out there. For those of you looking to sample the local tipple, we suggest you head to Beisl Bar. This cosy pub in the centre of town serves a range of local schnapps.</p>
<p>If sipping a gin and tonic is more your thing, then Woods Bar by the cross-country tracks and ice rink provides a chilled environment in which to enjoy your drink. Head there every Friday and Saturday for live DJ music. The open-air Snowbar on Geigenbulle is a great place to unwind. An open fire heats up the bar from around 4pm and the ambience is complimented by local music. The bar offers snow rafting every Monday and Wednesday.</p>
<h3><strong>Shopping</strong></h3>
<p>The pedestrianised town centre is especially good for visitors to Seefeld who would prefer to spend their day shopping rather than hitting the slopes. There are plenty of souvenir shops as well as sports shops making it easy to rent any ski equipment you might require. The beautiful city of Innsbruck is only 30 minutes away by train and has a plethora of shops ranging from exclusively Christmas themed souvenirs to luxury boutiques.</p>
<p>Shops are open Monday to Saturday between 10am–1pm and 2pm–6pm while supermarkets stay open longer, from 8am–6pm and on Sunday mornings.</p>
<h3><strong>Spas and relaxation</strong></h3>
<p>With many of the hotels in Seefeld offering spa facilities, you can be assured of a relaxing winter break when you visit. The Krumers Post and Spa Hotel provides a fantastic 2,200m<sup>2 </sup>spa area which even includes a panoramic indoor pool. Should your hotel not provide you with the spa facilities you require you should head to the Olympia Sports Centre. Not only does this come complete with indoor and outdoor pools and water slides, there are over 10 different types of sauna and treatment rooms available for guests to take advantage of.</p>
<h3><strong>Arts, culture, and events</strong></h3>
<p>Seefeld has a jam-packed schedule of winter events, from concerts and live music performances to competitive sports. Seefeld hosts regular cross-country ski races as well as other winter sports tournaments, including championship snow polo which, with its riders on horseback, makes for an exciting spectacle.</p>
<p>The Seefelder Schneefest der Nationen – or ‘Snow Festival of the Nations’ is a magical event hosted every year. Sculpture students from across the local region transform huge, 3m x 3m blocks of ice into spectacularly carved creations. During the night the statues are lit-up, giving them an ethereal appearance much loved by adults and children alike. The sculptures are complimented by music performances and an evening light parade with costumed fire blowers and women on stilts.</p>
<p>Seefeld has a rich history particularly as a site of pilgrimage. The village became a sacred destination during the 14<sup>th</sup> century after the ‘Host Miracle’ in which the ground opened up in the middle of a church service, swallowing a knight in punishment for his greed. A monastery was built in 1516 to accommodate the many pilgrims. But today you are much more likely to find skiers than religious pilgrims, and what remains of the monastery has become a local hotel.</p>
<h2>Seefeld resort activities </h2>
<h3><strong>Winter walking and snow-shoeing</strong></h3>
<p>Winter walking is a way of life in Seefeld and a popular activity for the many visitors the village receives during the snowy months of the year. There are approximately 142km of hiking trails available. We’d highly recommend the walk to the Wildmoos Alm which takes you through beautiful countryside. You can reward yourself at the end of your trek with one of the tastiest strudels on the mountains. All varieties of walking are catered from Nordic walking to llama trekking. Snow-shoeing is a popular past-time and snow-shoes can be hired locally. There are even candle-lit walks for those of you who fancy a romantic night-time stroll.</p>
<h3><strong>Horse-drawn sleigh rides</strong></h3>
<p>Horse-drawn sleigh rides around the Wildesee lake are one of the most popular non-ski activities for visitors to Seefeld. It is a romantic way to explore this beautiful winter wonderland. Visitors can book this experience locally which costs around €16 per passenger on a 45-minute sleigh ride.</p>
<h3><strong>Sightseeing in Innsbruck</strong></h3>
<p>The main line from Munich to Innsbruck passes through Seefeld and the train station is located directly in the centre of town. With a journey time of 2 hours 15 minutes Munich can be visited on a long day trip but visiting Innsbruck is really easy. The journey only takes 40 minutes and the trains run hourly. We recommend sitting on the right-hand side of the train towards Innsbruck to witness spectacular views down across the Inn Valley.</p>
<p>Winter Walking: The winter walking is exceptional too. There are 142km of cleared hiking trails around Seefeld which take you through idyllic plateaus, tranquil forests and stunning river valleys – a veritable winter wonderland. And we haven’t even mentioned the downhill skiing yet!</p>
<h3><strong>Child Care Facilities</strong></h3>
<p>Gizzi's Children's Club is a  Snow Kindergarten for children aged 3-5yrs, Mon-Fri, with 2 h per day ski tuition plus optional lunch supervision. Lessons are from <span>9.30am - 11.30am </span>price for 5 days including lunch and supervision 12-2pm is €249 <span>or</span><span> 12am - 2pm</span><span> ski lessons</span> without the lunch €143. Bookable locally.</p>
