<p><strong>DAY 1 | ARRIVAL &amp; NORTHERN LIGHTS SAMI CAMP<br /></strong></p>
<p>Your Inghams Representative will welcome you at Evenes Airport and take you by coach (a short 45 minute drive) to your chosen hotel in Harstad – either the <a data-udi="umb://document/7be32c8182f04a828182d051fe43bb18" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7be32c8182f04a828182d051fe43bb18}" title="Thon Hotel"><strong>Hotel Thon</strong></a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/0f81e0e90be042c4a9074b3abc35a1ee" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0f81e0e90be042c4a9074b3abc35a1ee}" title="Scandic Hotel"><strong>Hotel Scandic</strong></a></p>
<p>After settling in, join us for a short ‘orientation walk’ around the town of <a data-udi="umb://document/32d5eaa2d11e4d228a79550b66ff210f" href="/{localLink:umb://document/32d5eaa2d11e4d228a79550b66ff210f}" title="Harstad - Arctic Fjord Adventure"><strong>Harstad</strong></a> including the harbour, market square, high street and spa, to help you get your bearings.</p>
<p>In the evening, you will be met by your Inghams Representative and taken on an unforgettable trip. You’ll head out of town and away from any light pollution into the surrounding snowy landscape to a Sami camp and in search of the Northern Lights. Being directly under the <strong>Aurora Borealis</strong> belt is said to improve your chances of seeing the <a data-udi="umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271" href="/{localLink:umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271}" title="Northern Lights"><strong>Northern Lights</strong></a> natural phenomenon, guaranteed to take your breath away.</p>
<p>This is a truly unique experience and the perfect setting to witness the beauty of the Northern Lights. Walk down a snowy pathway to your setting for the evening - a traditional ‘Lavvu’ tent. You’ll be greeted with an ‘Aurora Cocktail’, a delicious sweet bright green drink served in an ice glass. While you wait for the Northern Lights to begin their dance across the sky, you’ll enjoy a traditional, warming dinner around the campfire inside, where your ‘Sami’ host will tell your stories about the culture and history of the Sami people.  Traditionally nomadic people, ancient folklore and legend play a strong part in the Sami people’s history, who believed the <strong>Northern Lights</strong> were a phenomenon caused by the energy of their ancestor’s souls flying across the sky! Relax and enjoy the friendly atmosphere inside the tent, and be ready to step out into the crisp night air to admire the spectacular performance of the Northern Lights.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a warm fire inside the tent but you’ll want some thermal layers, good boots and hat and gloves tonight for searching for the Northern Lights.</li>
<li>Take a camera with you as your smart phone camera will not capture the Northern Lights.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DAY 2 | SEASCAPES &amp; NORTHERN LIGHTS SAFARI<br /></strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13052845/kopi-av-170115_everyday_077.jpg" alt="Rib tour" width="714" height="341" rel="840,401" /></p>
<p>Following a hearty buffet breakfast, you’ll be met at your hotel and escorted a few minutes away where you’ll set off on a brilliant <strong>RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) sea safari</strong> onto the <strong>Vågsfjorden</strong>, surrounded by one of Norway’s most scenic island archipelagos - you really get close to nature!<br /><br />You’ll be kitted out with thermal suits and goggles to protect you from the sea spray as well as hats, gloves and boots if you wish so no need to take any extra clothing with you. The boat will go as fast or slow as the passengers wish so if you want an adrenaline boosting race through the waves you’ve got it! Or if you’d prefer a slower pace to enjoy the scenery that’s what you’ll get, the drivers will make sure all passengers are in their comfort zone. Your drivers, <strong>Johann and Oddvar</strong>, stop regularly on the journey to give you fascinating insights into the history of the area and local wildlife, so this is an educational trip as well as an enjoyable chance to get closer to nature.</p>
<p>The highlight of the RIB Safari is the snowy mountainous scenery either side of you as you ride through the fjord with no one else around. And there’s a whole array of wildlife to look out for, including <strong>sea eagles, kittiwakes</strong> and other birdlife, as well as <strong>seals</strong> and sometimes even <strong>whales</strong>,  so remember your binoculars and a camera! The boat will stop along the way in the sheltered, calmer waters of the fjords and your guides will explain how the land has changed since the Ice Age, the various wildlife that habitats here  and get up close to the remote ‘bird island’, home to over 10,000 birds!</p>
<p>You’ll stop for a <strong>relaxing and warming lunch at a remote waterside cabin</strong> with outstanding panoramic views. Breathe in the fresh fjord air and see if you can spot some Eagles soaring overhead. <br /><br /><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take the hats and gloves offered to you for the RIB so you can save your own and keep them warm and dry for your return. Thermal suits and footwear are provided locally for this trip.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />When you return to Harstad you’ll have an afternoon of leisure to explore, we recommend a visit to Harstad’s <strong>‘Grottebadet’ indoor pool and spa</strong> (approx. £11 local charge) – the perfect place to relax after the morning’s thrills.</p>
<p><span>This evening, you’ll join a two hour excursion to ‘<strong>In Search of the Northern Lights’</strong>, after dinner your guide will take you by minibus to locations around Harstad in search of wonderful views of the Northern Lights. As and when this beautiful sight appears, you’ll stop to admire the show and take your photos (your guide will give you tips on how to take the best photos of the Northern Lights). Hot drinks and snacks will be supplied. This is an adventure not to be missed as you become an Aurora Chaser for the night. </span></p>
<p><br /><img src="/" alt="Sami cooking" width="859" height="437" /><br /><br /><strong>DAY 3 | ‘HISTORIC HARSTAD’ TOUR &amp; RØKENES FARM FEAST</strong></p>
<p>The highlight of the historic tour of Harstad is the <strong>World War ll</strong> ‘Adolf Gun’. To tour this is a very special experience. It is still located inside a military base, so guests are only able to visit the gun with our guide. <strong>The Adolf Gun</strong> is one of the world's largest land-based guns, your guide will explain the detailed and interesting history of the gun and the role it played during the war for the German army, and Harstad’s history as an ally to the British. Inside, the gun looks exactly like it could have done when it was left in 1945 with original machines and plenty of artefacts still in place.  It’s difficult to appreciate the sheer scale and size of this gun until you see it first-hand. You can even climb into the 46cm diameter barrel of the gun for a unique photo opportunity!</p>
<p>You will also visit the picturesque <strong>Trondenes Church</strong>, a tall white building, which has been on the edge of the Vågsfjorden for over 750yrs since 1250 and provides spectacular views. Now a protected building, a visit inside to see the beautiful and richly-decorated interior, which reflects the church’s journey through time, is only possible with our guide.  Afterwards, you'll head inside the <strong>Trondenes Heritage Centre</strong> to discover this area's past dating back to the Viking era.<br /><br />Your final morning stop is<strong> Røkenes Manor and Farm</strong>, owned by ten generations of the Kulseng family since 1673. No longer a working farm, it is now renowned for its culinary traditions. Enjoy a tour of the estate and a delicious buffet lunch.  The tour gives you insights and tales from its history, with a peak inside the historic building, originally a family home. Then the former cowshed - now a delightful banqueting hall - sets the scene for a <strong>memorable lunch feast,</strong> with a buffet of fresh local specialities. </p>
<p><strong>'UMAMI' FAREWELL GOURMET DINING EXPERIENCE (Tues for 3 night breaks, Sat for 4 night breaks)</strong></p>
<p><span>Your final evening brings you an authentic dining experience in the way of a fantastic </span><strong>‘Umami’</strong><span> gourmet dinner. ‘Umami’ roughly translates as ‘tasty and delicious’ in Japanese and is known as ‘the fifth taste’, said to enhance the other four base flavours of sweet, salty, sour and bitter. </span><br /><br /><span>Created by locally renowned chefs, <strong>Sigrid Rafaelsen and Kim Håvard Larsen</strong>, and served in a roof-top setting, this is certainly a very tasty and memorable experience. Sigrid and Kim </span><span>Håvard's restaurant 'Umami' is one of Harstad's and<strong> Northern Norway's top rated restaurants</strong>. </span><span>You’ll enjoy three delicious courses with all ingredients sourced locally and from the fjords, and prepared to perfection. The chefs also double up as your waiters and will explain the '<strong>story behind the food</strong>', so ask them as many questions as you like. You can also choose to savour the perfectly-paired wine selected for each course (pay locally ). This is absolutely a taste sensation and a very special unique experience. </span></p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 (for 3-night breaks Sun-Weds) | RETURN TO UK</strong></p>
<p>Guests on our 3-night adventure have the morning at leisure in Harstad, before the transfer coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 | (for 4-night breaks Weds - Sun) <strong>| FJORD CRUISE AND GRYTOYA FISHING VILLAGE </strong></strong></p>
<p>Following breakfast at the hotel, you’ll board <strong>MS Stronstad</strong> to discover the pretty skerries and islands which surround Harstad. After meeting your guided on board, you’ll set sail and glide past magnificent Norwegian scenery of snow-covered mountains protruding from the rich, dark blue waters of the fjords either side of you and watch as darkness turns to daylight. Look out for wildlife on the way. Today is not a good day to forget your camera! Hot drinks will be available to purchase on board (pay locally), as you learn about Norway's coastal culture and nature,  as well as how life used to be in this Arctic region. </p>
<p>A lunch with the traditional flavours of the sea will be served on board before we head to <strong>Grytoya</strong> for a culture walking tour of a <strong>working fishing village</strong>, where you'll learn from the local fishermen and their way of life, and what life is like here in the Arctic before boarding the boat back to Harstad. </p>
<p>The afternoon is free time to relax, or to treat yourself to a little shopping for souvenirs of this memorable trip before your special farewell 'Umami' dinner - see above.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need layers to keep warm outside and on the boat </li>
<li>On the island tour, keep your eyes (and cameras) peeled for wildlife.</li>
</ul>
