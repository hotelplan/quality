<h4>1. Walking</h4>
<p>Take a stroll through the stunning scenery of the Dolomites where the view alters as the light changes. Walking isn’t only for the summer months, in the winter you can walk through snow covered trees and by frozen lakes.</p>
<h4>2. Ice Skating</h4>
<p>Visit the Stadio Olimpico del Ghiaccio, the Olympic Ice-Skating rink built in the 1950’s. Originally an open air stadium built to hold between 7000 to 8000 people, in 1956 the Olympics were held here and the arena was used for the figure staking events. Why not rent some skates and try out ice-skating yourself during the day, or watch the local ice hockey team, SG Cortina play a match in the evening!</p>

<h4>3. Venice</h4>
<p>A day in Venice is a nice change to the mountains and snow. Situated across a group of 117 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges, Venice is the perfect place to head for a day away. You may have been to Venice during the summer, but the winter in Venice is so much more relaxing and cooler. Venice is renowned for its beauty, architecture, and artwork. With just a two and a half hour journey from Cortina, this is definitely not to be missed!</p>
<h4>4. Spa Day</h4>
<p>Visit the local Grand Hotel Savoia for a relaxing spa day. Finnish saunas, Turkish baths, pools, hyrdomassage tubs, and more. It’s all available in Cortina and it’s the perfect way to relax. If that isn’t enough for you, try a massage or treatment and have a dip in the pool after!</p>
<h4>5. Shopping</h4>
<p>Whether you just want souvenirs or to treat yourself to something special, Cortina’s Corsa Italia, the main pedestrianised road, has something for everyone! Shopping for the latest fashion trends is a must in Cortina, and the Corsa Italia is the place to see and be seen by Italy’s fashionistas. The street is lined with trendy, designer boutiques as well as more traditional stores.</p>
