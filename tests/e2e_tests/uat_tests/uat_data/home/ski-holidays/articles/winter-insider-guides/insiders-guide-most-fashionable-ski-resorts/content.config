<h2>Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy</h2>
<a name="cortina"></a>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/media/13070131/insiders-guide-fashionable-resorts-cortina.jpg" alt="Fashionable skiing in Cortina" data-udi="umb://media/6c8ee85d264c448daed6d29a8882c932" /></p>
<p>It’s <a data-udi="umb://document/2dcb1a3292da421780aa165d449493a9" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2dcb1a3292da421780aa165d449493a9}" title="Cortina D’Ampezzo"><strong>Cortina</strong></a>! The glitziest and most glamourous of all the Italian ski resorts. Known as the ‘Queen of the Dolomites’, Cortina is recognised as the most fashionable ski resort in <a data-udi="umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902" href="/{localLink:umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902}" title="Italy"><strong>Italy</strong></a>. We’d be remiss not to include it on this list.</p>
<p>Cortina’s high street is lined with boutique shops, art galleries, and even a yachting shop! You’re just as likely to see people wandering the streets in sophisticated, fur coats as you are to see them in ski gear – especially during the 5pm ‘passeggiata’, the traditional, Italian, evening stroll. This is a great time to peruse the designer shops, or enjoy an Aperol Spritz in a classy bar.</p>
<p>Adding to the resort’s allure, it is one of the most filmed and photographed resorts in the Italian Alps. The resort was a prominent location in the James Bond film, <em>For Your Eyes Only</em>, which is hardly surprising, Cortina is surrounded by stunning mountain scenery. The iconic, jagged peaks of the Dolomite Mountains rise up around the resort giving it a very cinematic look and feel.</p>

Popular with the rich and famous, <a data-udi="umb://document/9e7d0f01e7964af0b7ee7c501cb0e893" href="/{localLink:umb://document/9e7d0f01e7964af0b7ee7c501cb0e893}" title="Courchevel"><strong>Courchevel</strong> </a>was the choice for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first family ski holiday with Prince George and Princess Charlotte in 2016.</p>
<p>Courchevel 1850, the highest village in the ski resort, has a wealth of boutique shops selling high-end luxury clothing, jewellery and perfume. <strong><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/france/three-valleys-ski-area/courchevel/hotel-fahrenheit-seven-1650" title="Hotel Fahrenheit Seven">Hotel Fahrenheit Seven</a></strong> provides some fantastic views - you'll either be greeted by the slopes and Moriond snow front or you'll be treated to views of the Courchevel valley and some amazing sunsets. The location is also ideal as the hotel is only a 100m walk to the centre of Courchevel 1650 providing a selection of shops, restaurants and bars to fill your time when you're not on the slopes.</p>
<p>The ski resort has an exceptional fine dining culture too. Courchevel 1850 alone has five Michelin starred restaurants, with Michelin starred restaurants in nearby Le Praz and La Tania as well. If you wanted to, you could eat at a Michelin starred restaurant for every night of your 7-night holiday.</p>

The resort centre, built largely in the traditional style is full of swanky, luxury shops and a stylish range of hotels offering incredible spa and wellness facilities, we highly recommend the <a data-udi="umb://document/10a32044f617456e86093130fa7140b7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/10a32044f617456e86093130fa7140b7}" title="Hotel Brigitte"><strong>Hotel Brigitte</strong></a> and the <a data-udi="umb://document/6b447f439b0c47be9d609e5b845c8d73" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6b447f439b0c47be9d609e5b845c8d73}" title="Hotel Solaria"><strong>Hotel Solaria</strong></a>, both renowned for their excellent service and cuisine.</p>
<p>The resort is also renowned for its après ski scene, which is equal parts lively and sophisticated. You won’t struggle to find classy nightclubs and chic champagne bars, but you’ll also have the opportunity to enjoy regular, on-mountain concerts such as this year’s Mountain Opening Concert, which is being headlined by Jason Derulo.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget Ischgl’s fantastic skiing either. The resort has an ultra-modern lift system providing incredible access to the 238km of piste. The ski area is wonderful for intermediate skiers with plentiful cruising red runs, while advanced skiers will be impressed with the free ride opportunities.</p>
