<p>A documentary which takes to the highest peaks around the world, featuring breath-taking imagery and thought-provoking narration.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>This documentary is a real treat for the senses and will evoke your love for the mountains all over again.  With its dramatic music and diverse camera shots 'Mountain' really gets your heart racing. Celebrating everything we love about the mountains, this film draws you in and makes you feel like you are climbing the summit of the mountain or skiing down it yourself!<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<h3>The Crash Reel (2013)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13064677/swiss-chocolate.jpg" alt="The Crash Reel" data-udi="umb://media/67d3cffa0a7545909a75381f7861daec" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentary about the epic rivalry between half-pipe legends Shaun White and Kevin Pearce, childhood friends who become number one and two in the world leading up to the Vancouver Winter Olympics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>Brace yourself – this documentary is pretty hard hitting, but 100% worth a watch. It follows the journey of Kevin, who in the pursuit of his dream, has a horrible accident.  It really makes you think about how lucky you are and to never take things for granted. And if you’re a snowboarder it would definitely make you think twice about attempting that half-pipe…<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<h3>Chalet Girl (2011)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13084948/st-anton-am-arlberg-2.jpg" alt="Chalet Girl - Movie Night" data-udi="umb://media/3267de019ca242cc982f6ce544ff4479" /></p>
<p>Former skateboard champion Kim wants to make more money after her mother's tragic death. She joins the elite posh servicing company, which sends her off to the Austrian Alps.</p>
<p><strong>Our review</strong></p>
<p>A chic flic which has given many chalet girls like myself a very false representation of what it is like to work as a chalet host in the Alps. However, it’s an uplifting, funny watch and shows just how easy it is to fall in love…. with the mountains.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<h3>Steep (2007)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13083011/hiv14-freeride-chamonix-tourist-office-christophe-henry.jpg" alt="Steep - Movie Night 2" data-udi="umb://media/2a46630255b842768a2bb055e05e6893" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentary about high-octane adventure and athleticism on skis. It tells the story of big mountain skiing, which started in France in the 70’s, where skiers did descents so extreme they seemed suicidal, where the prize is the exhilaration of exploring big, wild, remote mountains. </span></p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>One for the daredevils out there – this documentary explores why extreme skiers do what they do and risk their lives on the mountain. There’s film footage of some of the greatest steep skiing moments and interviews with the skiers themselves, some of which are no longer with us, which makes the risk feel even more real.</p>

<h3>Eddie the Eagle (2016)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13064674/noway-fjords.jpg" alt="Eddie the Eagle" data-udi="umb://media/3c5504cd8cc14ddb8aba5573a6dabf04" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story of Eddie Edwards, the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>This is such a feel good film. It’s based on Eddie’s true story (take with a pinch of salt) of competing in ski jumping at the Olympic games, against all odds. You’ll be rooting for Eddie whilst cringing at the possibility of many broken bones.</p>

<h3>Warren Miller's Here There &amp; Everywhere (2016)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13064674/noway-fjords.jpg" alt="Warren Miller's Here There &amp; Everywhere" data-udi="umb://media/3c5504cd8cc14ddb8aba5573a6dabf04" /></p>
<p>We’re revisiting some of Warren’s favourite places, from Switzerland to Montana, Greenland and everywhere in between, we went where our legacy took us. We went Here, There, And Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>If you’re not missing the slopes, then you certainly will be after watching this. It’s fascinating to learn about the history of snow sports and listen to Warren reminisce about his many years on the slopes.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<h3>Streif: One hell of a ride (2014)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13084919/winter-kitzbuehel-3.jpg" alt="Hell of a Ride - Movie Night" data-udi="umb://media/143a4b60bacb487d980292b53b1c55b1" /></p>
<p>An adrenaline charged documentary about the legendary Hahnenkamm ski race in Kitzbühel. For those of you that probably think that the hardest thing about the race is how to spell it – think again! Now celebrating its 75th anniversary, the annual Hahnenkamm race in Kitzbühel, Austria, has produced unforgettable triumphs and heartrending tragedies, a heritage that is full of myths and legends. Nowhere else is skiing celebrated so intensely. The city, the nation, and the entire winter sports world go crazy for the battles that play out on the slopes. <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>This film is for anyone who watches Ski Sunday and thinks ski racing looks easy! The film follows a number of World Cup skiers through the build up to the biggest, most dangerous race on the calendar. Training in the summer, intensive workouts and loads of practice to be the best in the world. Brilliant camera work puts you in the race which is much more immersive than what you usually watch on TV. </p>

<h3>The Spirit of Flatness (2018)</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13070010/snowmobile.jpg" alt="Spirit - Finland" data-udi="umb://media/64904e261cd642ab923a20ffe785a810" /></p>
<p>A documentary film about traveling through <strong>Finland</strong>, snowboarding and figuring out how to practice this sport in such difficult conditions. Finland has some of the best snowboarders in the world, so invited were two interesting riders on this trip. In the film, they are driving 350km into the Arctic Circle and show the highest mountain top where probably no one has been seen on a snowboard before.</p>
<p><strong>Our Review</strong></p>
<p>Short but sweet this documentary is a must-see for any snowboarder. Full of cool graphics and beautiful scenery, it offers half an hour of pure escapism. It's amazing to see how much Finland celebrates snowboarding, from training camps to slopes open at night and street snowparks, there's a true freedom for the sport that's rarely seen anywhere else. <span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black;"></span></p>
