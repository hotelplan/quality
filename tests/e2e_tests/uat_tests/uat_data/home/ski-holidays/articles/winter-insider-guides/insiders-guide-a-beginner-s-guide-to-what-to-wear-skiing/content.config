<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Ski pants &amp; salopettes</span></p>
<p><img src="/media/13072329/inghams12.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Ski pants or salopettes, also have key technical features you should consider. The most versatile ski pants are uninsulated shells with a lining for warmth, although if you feel the cold maybe consider buying a pair of base layer bottoms. Waterproof ski pants or salopettes are a must no matter what the time of year or destination, as we’re all prone to the occasional fall, and we recommend checking they have snow gaiters to prevent snow from getting in! Also look out for thigh vents, as they help with air circulation and temperature regulation. Material composition is also an important factor: some ski pants are reinforced in areas to prevent damage from boots and rips, and many salopettes will incorporate stretch materials to increase range of movement and flexibility.</p>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Googles</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13072333/inghams4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A decent pair of ski goggles is an essential ski accessory. You’ll need them for protection, as the combination of high altitude and snow reflection can be very damaging for your eyes, and to keep the wind out while you’re skiing. You don’t need to spend a fortune; entry level googles can cost around £50 and will be more than adequate for your first few ski trips. The more expensive pairs will have additional features and better quality lenses for improved visibility.</p>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Helmet</h2>
<p>You may have planned to hire a ski helmet, but Snow+Rock recommends bringing your own for key safety reasons. Not only is it more comfortable, but when you rent a helmet, you can’t be sure how old it is, how many knocks it’s taken, and how serious the knocks have been. Having your own means that you know its story, and as a result, how safe you are wearing it on the slopes. Plus, wearing a helmet that’s been on many other sweaty heads is not the most hygienic option!</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Ski Socks</h2>
<p>Far more important than they’re given credit for, ski socks have the potential to make or break a skiing holiday. Technical ski socks are crafted for a superior fit (no scrunching up inside ski boots), and to ensure your feet stay warm without the need for extra thick socks, which can compromise your control over your skis. Make sure the socks you choose have moisture wicking properties to control odour and moisture. If possible, it’s a good idea to try them on with the ski boots you’ll be using on your ski holiday.</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Gloves or mittens</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13072331/inghams2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Waterproof gloves or mittens are an essential to keep your hands dry, warm and comfortable on the slopes. Mittens generally tend to be warmer than gloves, but gloves allow for a slightly better hold on your ski poles. Those who really feel the cold may choose to use glove liners for extra insulation. Look for DWR (Durable Water Repellent) treated outer shells, and GORE-TEX composition, as these are indicators of waterproofing and durability.</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Hat and scarf</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13072323/inghams6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You’ll need to keep even warmer off-piste than you will skiing, so it’s a good idea to have a warm hat and scarf with you to keep out the chill. You may also choose to wear a scarf, or a lighter weight neck warmer, while skiing.</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Snow boots</h2>
<p>Snow boots are the ideal footwear choice when you’re not on the slopes skiing. Warm, water-resistant and with plenty of grip, snow boots are perfect for getting around the ski resort and ensuring you enjoy the après ski in style.</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Sunglasses</h2>
<p>As mentioned with ski goggles, protecting your eyes on the mountains is hugely important, but don’t forget protection for off the slopes! Sunglasses will make sure you’re comfortable and don’t damage your eyes around the resort, or when stopping for lunch on the slopes.</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Rucksack</h2>
<p>Make sure the rucksack you choose for your first ski holiday is big enough for all your essentials (water, SPF, snacks, spare hat and gloves), and has a waist strap to keep it securely in place as you carve up the piste. Other technical features to look out for include helmet storage, hydration compatibility, waterproof or rain cover, integrated emergency whistle – to name just a few!</p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13072305/snow_rock_insidersguide_geararticle_boots.jpg" alt=" alt=" /></p>
<p>After your first ski trip, we know you’ll be counting the days until the next! Once you know you’ll be hitting the slopes again and again, Snow+Rock recommends investing in your own ski boots and skis. Comfortable, well-fitting ski boots are an essential component. Nobody wants footwear which rubs and leaves painful blisters, but in the case of skiing, poorly fitting boots can hugely impact your safety, how well you control your skis, and generally how much you enjoy your holiday! Because every foot is unique, the only way to get the ideal fit is by having your ski boots fitted by a professional. Snow+Rock’s in-store experts will not only be able to match you with your perfect pair; they can also make subtle amends to boots if there are points of pressure, free of charge. Snow+Rock also offer custom insoles, moulded to your foot shape for the ultimate in comfort and support. Having your own skis offers a great advantage when you’re learning more advanced techniques and want to improve your performance. The selection of skis can be overwhelming, but a Snow+Rock expert will be able to advise on which skis you’ll need for your experience level and skiing style.</p>

This insider guide aims to take you off the beaten track and guide you through some of best kept secrets in the region. </p>

<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h3>Brunch with a view<span class="location-text page-title"></span></h3>
<p><img style="width: 828px; height: 444px;" src="/media/13084958/st-anton-am-arlberg-15.jpg?width=828&amp;height=444&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/9a1d10f202af49f58cafb4d7886501d8" /></p>
<p><span>Head to the Galzig, one of the three main connecting gondolas from the centre of St Anton and catch the connecting Valluga cable car. Follow red 19 to experience a stunning view point and a superb spot for morning brunch.</span></p>
<p><span>The viewpoint overlooks the expanse of the Arlberg mountain range and provides the opportunity for a fantastic spot for a coffee break at the Valluga View restaurant.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h3>Ready for a challenge?<span class="location-text page-title"></span></h3>
<p><span class="location-text page-title"><img style="width: 840px; height: 450px;" src="/media/13084946/st-antom-am-arlberg.jpeg?width=840&amp;height=450&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/c70ae28d44af4779b691f783f7f0ef81" /></span></p>
<p><span>After taking in the expansive views from the Valluga it is time to challenge yourself on the longest run in the Alberg region.  7km long – Red 20, Blue 17 and S1 connects this challenging on and off piste run. A popular run for the whole group as the run is suitable for skiers of all abilities.  The wide pisted terrain allows the beginners to feel comfortable on the slope whilst allowing the more advanced skier and boarder to attack the powder off piste.  This is simply a must for everyone visiting St Anton!</span></p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h3>Lunch Time<span class="location-text page-title"></span></h3>
<p><img style="width: 837px; height: 400px;" src="/media/13050140/st_anton_big.jpg?width=837&amp;height=400&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/daa1b7109c904e7a99c405e26f38a70d" /></p>
<p><span>At the Bottom of S1 catch the Albona 1 and Albona 11 chairlifts into the Stuben ski area. These lifts offer the skier a novelty of a rug for the journey whilst the chair follows the snow covered tree tops towards the pisted terrain.</span></p>
<p><span>As you exit the Albona II follow S4 towards the Albonagrat chairlift to reach one of the best lunch spots in the Arlberg region. It’s a great opportunity to enjoy a picnic and a thermos of gluhwein whilst taking in the picturesque panoramic views of Lech, St Christoph, St Anton, Stüben and the mountain ranges towards Sonnenkopf.</span></p>
