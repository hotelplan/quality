<p style="color: #003155;"><strong>It can be tough to keep everyone happy on a ski holiday. There will always be someone diving down the steepest black as soon as the first lifts open and another who prefers a leisurely lie-in and a gourmet breakfast.</strong></p>
<p>Finding that elusive ski resort which will please everybody in your group can be hard. Whether you’re travelling in a mixed ability group, partying with mates, or after a relaxing retreat with friends, we can suggest the best ski resorts for groups.</p>

<h3 style="color: #003155;">Tignes, France</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13082843/cande_stgm_mars018_2737.jpeg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/30e1a7f021414c6894b03dbe4987d97b" /></p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mixed ability</p>
<p>Finding the right mixture of challenging pistes and gentle cruising can be hard. Thankfully <a data-udi="umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565" href="/{localLink:umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565}" title="Tignes">Tignes</a> gets this mixture just right.</p>
<p>The gentle blue and green runs from the top of the Borsat chair are superb for beginners, while more significant challenges can be found on the Grand Motte glacier. A wealth of on-mountain and ski-to-the-door bars and restaurants also make it easy to arrange places to meet for lunch and at the end of the ski day. The après ski is awesome too!</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Great value parties in the snow</p>
<p>The friendly, laidback atmosphere in <a data-udi="umb://document/a0b1d3c577424320a9af2e1af08b6887" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0b1d3c577424320a9af2e1af08b6887}" title="Sauze d'Oulx">Sauze</a> makes it an ideal destination for skiing all day and partying until late into the night.

<h3 style="color: #003155;">Obergurgl, Austria</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13053001/top-mountain-star-002.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/014985bd57e7477d92a2f7a18b0a4b92" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Family ski groups</p>
<p>Known as the ‘Diamond of the Alps’, <a data-udi="umb://document/6063ab813f384ab795dc6aa1d337f576" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6063ab813f384ab795dc6aa1d337f576}" title="Obergurgl">Obergurgl</a> offers guaranteed snow, queue-free modern lifts and immaculate slope grooming. There are two beginner areas and a ski school with an excellent reputation, great for helping little ones find their ski legs. For intermediates there is an extensive choice for skiers who like long, spacious blue and red runs.</p>
<p>Obergurgl-Hochgurgl has some challenging black runs and good moguls on the unprepared ski routes or book a guide to explore the deep powder off-piste skiing on the Hohe Mut in Obergurgl. A day trip over to the glacier in Sölden is well worth it. As an experienced skier or boarder this area presents an exciting challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/obergurgl/the-moss" title="The Moss">The Moss</a></p>

<h3 style="color: #003155;">Zermatt, Switzerland</h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Advanced groups</p>
<p>Widely considered one of the best ski resorts in Europe, due to the endless on and off piste options, charming village and the iconic Matterhorn, <a data-udi="umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1}" title="Zermatt">Zermatt</a> is not to be missed by experienced skiers. With its extremely high altitudes and abundance of north facing slopes, powder-hounds will find plenty of deep snow, days after it falls. Adventurous skiers will find unlimited potential in the Monte Rosa area, one of the most heavily glaciated areas of Europe.</p>
<p>After a day laying tracks in deep powder and diving down couloirs, what could be more enjoyable than a drink with friends? Zermatt has a fun and lively après and night-time scene, with après starting at the end of the slopes in charming huts, and continuing into town with live music venues and nightclubs guaranteed to make an entertaining evening.</p>
