<strong>Snowboarding is one of the most exciting winter activities on the mountain. First emerging in 1965, the sport really rose in popularity in the late 70’s and early 80’s, and has been radically modernised from its original patent of two skis strapped together, to the single board we know of today.</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most snowboarders can appreciate that resorts that work so well for skiers, are not a “one-size-fits-all” for their boarder friends, and so we’ve put together a handy guide to the best resorts for snowboarders in the world.</p>

<h2>Les Arcs, <a data-udi="umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5}" title="France">France</a></h2>

<p><em><strong>Best for:</strong> Snow park Fanatics</em></p>
<p>"Home of the snowboard" Les Arc is one of the few resorts that can claim to be as good for snowboarders. With 425km of slopes, great terrain and free riding, Les Arc is perfect for all levels of snowboarding. Mont Blanc is an excellent option for intermediate snowboards while more advanced levels could take on the Belette and Myrtille runs for more of a challenge. Not forgetting the purpose built beginner area on top of Vallandry area for less experienced snowboarders. </p>
<p>A big attraction to Les Arce is the selection of snow parks with rails, kickers and jump, the park is set up to cater to all abilities. With the majority of Les Arc above 1600m snow conditions are reliable making Les Arc as snow sure as resorts come. </p>
<p>Les Arc is comprised of several villages with 1800 being famous for its nightlife, party goers should definitely consider staying there, however, although the other villages are limited there is still a small selection of bars to chose from.</p>

<h2>Mayrhofen, <a data-udi="umb://document/7cc7c659d5214aa9b4d7bed936a721bb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7cc7c659d5214aa9b4d7bed936a721bb}" title="Austria">Austria</a></h2>

<p><em>Best for: Après lovers</em></p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/f9068cb62c4d4b2299a0ef29fd676ed5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f9068cb62c4d4b2299a0ef29fd676ed5}" title="Mayrhofen"><strong>Mayrhofen</strong></a> has always been a popular destination for snowboarders. A favourite resort for British, professional boarders like Jamie Nicholls and Katie Ormerod, it’s not hard to see what makes Mayrhofen so attractive.</p>
<p>The resort is home to one of the best snowparks in Europe - the Vans Penken park. The wide ranging facilities include a rainbow-box and a huge wallride. The park is suitable for all abilities and has five sections: the funline, the public line, the proline, the half-pipe and the kids park.</p>
<p>On piste, Mayrhofen continues to impress. The Hintertux glacier provides reliable snow conditions throughout winter, and ambitious boarders will relish the opportunity to attempt Austria’s steepest run, the Harakiri.</p>
<p>But, it is Mayrhofen's thriving après scene that really draws the crowds. Lively bars and nightclubs make Mayrhofen a fun place to visit throughout the winter. And incredible festivals, the Altitude comedy festival in December and the infamous Snowbombing in April bookend the season. It’s a great resort for a party.</p>

<h2>Davos, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a></h2>

<p><em><strong>Best for:</strong> Thrill seekers</em></p>
<p>A bustling resort and town, <a data-udi="umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df}" title="Davos"><strong>Davos</strong></a> is an exceptional destination for advanced snowboarders. The linked region of Davos and <a data-udi="umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0}" title="Klosters"><strong>Klosters</strong></a> has six areas, five of which are covered under one lift pass, to choose from, so there’s no shortage of pistes to savour. The five main areas are Parsenn, Madrisa, Jakobshorn, Pischa and Rinerhorn. The sixth is Schatzalp, the smallest in size of the group.</p>
<p>In Jakobshorn you’ll find plenty of freestyle options at Jatzpark, with its excellent two line terrain containing tables, kickers and rails, along with a 120m halfpipe and a 22 foot wall superpipe, known by “O’Neill Evolution”, near the base, just above the Bolgen après ski bar. This snowpark offers fantastic evening boarding Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, until 9:30pm.</p>
<p>Freeriders have plenty to choose from, with Davos being coined as one of Europe’s best freeriding resorts. The lifts and cable cars conveniently transport you up to secured routes that have been signposted by the piste-grooming services for beginner and intermediate freeriders. In Pischa, advanced boarders will find one of the largest and sunniest freeride areas in <a data-udi="umb://document/52fab17731fa49639f8a0841e064a064" href="/{localLink:umb://document/52fab17731fa49639f8a0841e064a064}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. There, it is all untouched terrain and no slopes are marked, groomed or protected from alpine risks - a paradise for thrill seekers. Boarders who would prefer a day tour can hire a guide to take the Madrisa round trip, a classic tour that has been around for decades. The tour takes just under seven hours and goes from Klosters into Austria and back again. You can expect fantastic descents on varied slopes and an exceptional natural experience.</p>

<h2>Livigno, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/italy" title="Italy">Italy</a></h2>
<p><img src="/media/13083820/snowboard_1-_madnesssnowboardschool.jpg" alt="Livigno" data-udi="umb://media/3bfb4c0faad34002bba83cf229d8f883" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Best for: </em></strong><em>Freestyle novices </em></p>
<p>Livigno is making a big name for itself as now confirmed as one of the venues for the 2026 Olympics and it’s easy to see why. The unique layout means there are dedicated areas and lifts for beginners straight from resort level, while more experienced skiers and boarders can head to the top and enjoy a huge range of on and off-piste in the area.</p>
<p><br />Snowboarders are spoilt for choice! Livigno has two extreme snowboard parks where freestyle enthusiasts will love to be able to test themselves. The Mottolino snowpark has hosted many international freestyle competitions and is known for its daunting jumps. Although there's a lot of fun to be had on the rails, boxes and smaller jumps for less experienced snowboarders.</p>
<p><br />The town itself sits in the valley where either side of you, the mountains rise creating two separate ski areas, all linked by the efficiently and free local buses circulating the resort.</p>

<p><em><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone and everyone</em></p>
<p>Widely regarded as one of the best snowboarding resorts in the world, <a data-udi="umb://document/0c45d07f55a64313a6e4bc714b58b52d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0c45d07f55a64313a6e4bc714b58b52d}" title="Whistler"><strong>Whistler</strong></a> caters for a diverse range of snowboarders. From first-class snow parks, to world beating off piste and amazing, groomed slopes (it’s a cliché but) there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p>Whistler is an ideal place to begin your snowboarding hobby. There are a wealth of green slopes and dedicated ‘go slow’ zones. There are over 200 runs in the resort, making it one of the most extensive in North America.</p>
<p>The mountainside is dotted with terrain parks, all of which are clearly labelled  based on the required ability. Pro-freestylers love the Olympic standard half pipe, on Blackcomb Mountain and the Choker park provides incredible views as you tackle those medium and high jumps.</p>
<p>We’d also be remiss if we failed to comment on the amazing backcountry. Heli-boarding is a fantastic way to experience the Canadian wilderness: the beautiful scenery and incredible powder. Whistler truly is a stunning snowboarding resort.</p>
