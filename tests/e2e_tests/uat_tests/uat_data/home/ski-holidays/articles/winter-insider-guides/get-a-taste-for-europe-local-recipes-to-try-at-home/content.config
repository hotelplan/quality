<h2>ITALY</h2>
<p>The Dolomites Ski Region and Unesco World Heritage Site is home to the highest concentration of Michelin-starred chefs in Italy, so be sure to add this to the list if you consider yourself a’ foodie’. However, it doesn’t matter where you ski in <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902" href="/{localLink:umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902}" target="_blank" title="Italy">Italy</a>, great food surrounds you. No holiday is complete without stopping for a long lunch in the sun and enjoying a pasta dish and a glass of Aperol, is it?</p>
<p>Here are our <strong>savoury and sweet </strong>suggestions inspired by Italy…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Savoury - Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088569/adobestock_25737066.jpeg" alt="Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms" data-udi="umb://media/ca66a36af1904ba99ee84cc54df18d0f" /></p>
<p>Tagliatelle is one of the most-loved pasta dishes in Italy and when it is served with porcini mushrooms and pancetta, it really doesn’t get any better.</p>
<p>Keeping it simple and tasty, a traditional Italian pasta dish doesn’t require many ingredients and can be whipped up in a matter of minutes. Originating from Tuscany but widely popular throughout the whole of Italy, this superstar dish is a real winner.</p>
<p>We recommend Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms and pancetta, but it can be enjoyed with any meat or fish.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sweet - Tiramisu<br /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/media/13088566/adobestock_328016056.jpeg" alt="Tiramisu" data-udi="umb://media/6d9bf59a4ed64407bf1efd024c9124e0" /></p>
<p>A combination of rich creams, coffee and delectable sponge, there is no dessert more Italian than tiramisu. Served across the country, if you’re looking to remind yourself of your recent Italian ski holiday, this is the perfect dish.</p>
<p>Tiramisu is an authentic Italian dessert and one of the most famous Italian desserts in the world. Born in Treviso, a lovely town near Venice, this dish is now enjoyed across the globe, and in ski resorts across the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>It’s famous for a reason, it’s absolutely delicious. Coffee, chocolate and cream make it an irresistible dessert, in our opinion, there’s always room for tiramisu.</p>

<h2>AUSTRIA</h2>
<p>It’s not an easy task to choose from all of the tasty options on offer in an Austrian ski resort. From Tiroler Gröstl (a carb-fest of piping hot potatoes with bacon and onions) to Käsespäetzle (Austria’s take on Macaroni cheese). But we’ve given it a good go.</p>
<p>Here are our <strong>savoury and sweet suggestions</strong> inspired by Austria….</p>
<p><strong>Savoury - Wiener Schnitzel</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088572/adobestock_120656673.jpeg" alt="Wiener Schnitzel" data-udi="umb://media/e91b7ca93ede49d0a1ab5f4b9d552ed5" /></p>
<p>This authentic Austrian dish originates from the capital – Vienna. In Austria they are very particular that Wiener schnitzel is made using veal, however if you can’t get hold of any veal, then you can replace with chicken or pork, your secret’s safe with us! This a real home comfort dish, a crowd pleaser for the whole family. The Austrians usually serve this with lemon slices, green salad and French fries.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet - Apple Strudel<br /></strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088571/adobestock_248293526.jpeg" alt="Apple Strudel" data-udi="umb://media/6cb85b86f80a4a76999f3d4fb916a877" /></p>
<p>Another home comfort from Austria’s capital, the classic apple strudel. Vienna is a haven of coffee shops all selling the most beautiful pastries, and apple strudel is not one to be missed. Best enjoyed with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla custard with a strong cup of espresso. It’s sugar and spice and everything nice. Give it a try.</p>

<h2>SWITZERLAND</h2>
<p>The Swiss have style and that certainly applies to their food. Like the Dolomites, there are plenty of Michelin starred restaurants in Switzerland, in fact Zermatt has not one, not two, but four Michelin starred restaurants. How many stars does your cooking deserve?</p>
<p>Here are our <strong>savoury and sweet</strong> suggestions inspired by Switzerland….</p>
<p><strong>Savoury - Cheese Fondue</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088570/adobestock_249391401.jpeg" alt="Cheese Fondue" data-udi="umb://media/186b739fa60e472eabc8cb621ff6a912" /></p>
<p>One for the cheese lovers. This classic Swiss dish is typically enjoyed in the mountains after a long day on the slopes. But what’s to stop us from enjoying it in our homes with our families, or a fondue for one isn’t a bad idea either. You could graze on this dish all evening. Accompany with crusty bread to dip and a glass of white wine to sip. It’s actually suggested by the Swiss that you drink white wine with cheese as it helps with the digestion, whereas water, juice or beer will cause indigestion. If you say so, no arguments from us!</p>

<p><strong>Sweet – Swiss Roll</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088567/adobestock_248915420.jpeg" alt="Swiss roll" data-udi="umb://media/db86c6f7cd064164be4307ee20d2575f" /></p>
<p>We had to choose the famous Swiss roll. However, despite its name, the Swiss Roll did not actually originate in Switzerland, it is believed to originate elsewhere in Europe. This cake is seemingly famous worldwide, even in places such as Indonesia, India and Japan. It’s a perfect dessert to make for any occasion, choose from the classic Victoria sponge, red velvet or chocolate, whatever tickles your fancy.</p>

<h2>FRANCE</h2>
<p>Savoyard is famous in the French Alps, this style of cooking is based on a staple diet of cheese and potatoes. It’s very calorific and a great fuel source for a day on the slopes. We’ve picked our favourite Savoyard dish for you.</p>
<p>Here are our <strong>savoury and sweet</strong> suggestions inspired by France….</p>
<p><strong>Savoury - Tartiflette</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13088565/adobestock_99401798.jpeg" alt="Tartiflette" data-udi="umb://media/294e3c5f0b424a8abb6492c6116e2661" /></p>
<p>Tartiflette originated in Savoy in the French alps. It was purposely invented in an attempt to increase awareness of the Reblochon cheese. It’s safe to say that their plot certainly worked, as you will find tartiflette on every menu in the French Alps. Let’s just say, it’s not a meal your doctor would recommend having every night, but it certainly can’t hurt now and again! It is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons and onions and is oh so tasty. Just like the Cheese fondue from Switzerland, this cheese heavy meal requires a crisp glass of white wine to help with digestion.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet – Fruit &amp; Almond Clafoutis</strong></p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 268.49642004773267px;" src="/media/13088568/adobestock_97646834.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="Fruit &amp; Almond Clafoutis" data-udi="umb://media/56fe6bdec34d4a91b4ac7a71e6f4c7b6" /></p>
<p>This is a really easy summer French dessert, it may sound fancy by the name (pronounced kla-foo-tee), however it is super simple to make and an absolute delight to taste. This was recommended to us by our very own Rachel, who is the Area Manager in France throughout winter and summer, so we’re sure she’s done her research! You could be eating this melt in the mouth dessert in less than 1 hours’ time, what are you waiting for?</p>
