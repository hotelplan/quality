With our dedicated skiing holidays covering everything from travel, catering and resort knowledge - it’s a winter holiday to beat all the rest.</p>
<p>Our <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/5c6f2f5dfa2c4004b3e082a734fe1507" href="/{localLink:umb://document/5c6f2f5dfa2c4004b3e082a734fe1507}" title="Accommodation Options">accommodation options</a></strong> are close to the piste meaning there is little walking in your ski boots for little feet.</p>

Offering plenty of beginner areas, plus you can ski most of the resort at a beginner level due to La Rosiere being mainly blue runs.</p>
<p>If you have some children-free time or your children are getting pretty skilful on their skis, then a nice day skiing over the ridge of La Rosiere into La Thuile, Italy is a day well spent and a good place to stop for some authentic Italian Pizza.</p>
<p>All of La Rosiere’s lower slopes are family orientated and designed with children and beginner skiers in mind. Meaning you and your children can feel safe, with space to practise.</p>
<p>The great advantage of La Rosiere is that it is a <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/3d2e5b1e3fb14ecd863a5723d5c4fc55" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3d2e5b1e3fb14ecd863a5723d5c4fc55}" title="Insider's Guide: Best High Altitude Ski Resorts">high-altitude</a></strong> resort and therefore has a good <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/d34970b6ad474172a995bc9aba474353" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d34970b6ad474172a995bc9aba474353}" title="Insider’s Guide: Top 10 snow-sure ski resorts in Europe" data-anchor="#">snow record</a></strong>, meaning you are very likely to have a snow-sure holiday.</p>
<p>As this resort has a south-facing slope, it tends to be one of the <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/12bd4a4ee646409da325b1a1e0772b45" href="/{localLink:umb://document/12bd4a4ee646409da325b1a1e0772b45}" title="Sunniest Ski Resorts in Europe &amp; Canada">sunniest</a></strong> in the area. This is great when you have small children who you want to ensure stay warm and enjoy their skiing experiences. The sunny days provide visible and friendly conditions for those attempting their first snow-ploughs.</p>
<p>Though it might not mean much to the children, for the parents however, the views in this area are one of a kind - most enticing is the spectacular views of <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/43703d590ae4451faee0e5625182ac02" href="/{localLink:umb://document/43703d590ae4451faee0e5625182ac02}" title="Insider's Guide: The ultimate mountain icons">Mont Blanc</a></strong> that you can appreciate as you swoop down the mountain runs.</p>
<p>If you want a day's rest from skiing, there is plenty of in-resort entertainment, so every day can be full of fun. From bowling, a cinema to ice skating, there is something to occupy your little ones.</p>
<p>When you are seeking a bit of outdoor adventure off the skis, there is a wonderful and magical family walk called 'Narnia' that takes you through the woods to the other side of the resort.</p>

This initiative from France is about resorts (and other tourist destinations) commitment towards environmental issues. Inghams resort Tignes has already earned this badge. Meaning we are collectively working to ensure our planet's mountains stay snowy for our children's future ski adventures.</p>

<h3>Avoriaz</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13082954/photoingfravw1412apr15.jpg" alt="AvoriazSkiing" data-udi="umb://media/6a04d216160a4f7397db04d1c495204d" /></p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small, family friendly, purpose built ski resort</li>
<li>Excellent quality lessons with ESF ski school</li>
<li>Extensive Portes du Soleil ski area</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the major delights of Avoriaz, besides the stunning scenery, is its design. The village is a purpose-built ski resort and, because of that, no door is more than 50m away from the centre of the village. The whole area is unbelievably convenient for the modern family, with ski-in/ski-out access from all of Inghams properties. No more carrying your family’s skis over a great distance!</p>
<p>Avoriaz is an ideal resort for learning to ski. The ski school is run by the internationally renowned Ecole du Ski Francais (ESF). Children from 3+ years old can join ESF and Piou Piou (a large yellow bird) in the Village des Enfants in Avoriaz 1800. Here they’ll learn the basics of skiing and snowboarding before advancing onto Big Bear level. Lesson structure includes morning or afternoon practice and the rest of the time is spent with kid’s club style play and crafts. The ESF are fantastic at keeping young children entertained and safe on the mountain.<br />Now you can learn to ski as a family too! ESF organise family lessons, so you can stick together on the mountain. These small family groups needn’t be for complete beginners either, and they provide a perfect opportunity for the whole gang to polish their technique with the help of a professional.</p>
<p>Avoriaz is one of the most recognisable ski resorts in the Portes du Soleil ski area, which crosses the border of France into Switzerland. As a massive ski area, it provides an enviable variety of skiing. It’s as well suited to beginners as it is for advanced and off-piste experts. The resort also has an established freestyle scene, with a number of snowparks including one dedicated to children – the Burton Kids Parkway.</p>
<p><strong>For the adults: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a family friendly resort, but that doesn’t mean the après ski scene isn’t alive and kicking in Avoriaz. There’s an incredible range of bars and restaurants, both on and off the piste. While the kids are in ski school, Mum and Dad can enjoy a drink while admiring the beauty of the snow and sun in the Portes du Soleil.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the whole family:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t forget your swimming costumes! On a whiteout day, families head to the fun-filled Aquariaz indoor swimming pool. With water slides, saunas, whirlpools, and more this non-ski attraction keeps everyone active and happy.</li>
</ul>
