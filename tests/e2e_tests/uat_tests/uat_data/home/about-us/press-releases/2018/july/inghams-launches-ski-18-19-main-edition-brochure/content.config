<div style="height: 15px; font-size: x-small; text-align: center;">New Inghams Ski &amp; Snowboarding Main Edition 2018/19 brochure.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Ski tour operator Inghams has launched its Ski 18/19 main edition brochure with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A NEW Ski Inclusive offer</li>
<li>NEW twin-centre holidays in Canada</li>
<li>Four NEW resorts: Sölden (Austria), La Clusaz (France), Samoëns (France), and Courmayeur (Italy)</li>
<li>Big group discounts: up to one in seven goes FREE</li>
</ul>
<p>The new brochure offers plenty of choice for the coming winter season, featuring over 90 ski resorts across eight countries and departures from 21 UK regional airports, as well as train travel and self-drive options.</p>
<p>Paul Carter, Chief Executive Officer, says: “We’re so excited to not only again be bringing our guests a new range of ski and snowboard holidays, but with the launch of a new style of brochure with a new feel. We’ve modernised our pages, supporting them with additional information on our website to really help our guests find the perfect ski holiday that’s right for them. What is not new, however, is our continued commitment to value: our new Ski Inclusive bundles reward guests who pre-book their lift passes, ski / board and boot hire with big savings. We also go the extra mile for groups, with some of the best discounts in the business including up to one in seven goes free! We can’t wait for winter and we look forward to welcoming our guests out on the slopes!”</p>
<p><strong><u>What’s New?</u></strong><strong>    </strong><br />For the Ski 18/19 season, Inghams has expanded its programme in Europe with the introduction of four new resorts, and in Canada with new twin-centre holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Canada Twin-Centres</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These give guests the opportunity to ‘kill two birds with one stone’ and ski some of the country’s finest resorts in one holiday. Options include the <strong>Best of Alberta</strong>, combining Jasper with Banff, and the <strong>Best of Canada</strong>, which includes Banff followed by Whistler. The hotel combinations have been especially selected to offer good-quality accommodation in both resorts, whilst creating an excellent-value two week ski break.                 <br /><strong>Stay seven nights at the four-star <u>Caribou Lodge</u> in Banff followed by seven nights at the four-star <u>Crystal Lodge &amp; Suites</u> in Whistler from £1,819 per person based on two sharing. Price includes return flights and all transfers including a domestic flight from Calgary to Vancouver. V</strong><strong>isit </strong><strong>www.inghams.co.uk/ski</strong><strong> or call </strong><strong>01483 791 114.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Sölden, Austria</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Boasting an expansive (254km), high-altitude ski area served by an impressive lift system, Sölden is an ideal choice for intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Two glaciers ensure a long season with guaranteed snow. Sölden also shares its whole area lift pass with neighbouring Obergurgl, which is only a short bus ride away. Inghams’ popular <strong>Meet The Piste</strong> service is available here, whereby the Rep provides free ski hosting to help guests discover the area and the best mountain lunch stops. The town’s legendary après ski scene competes with that of St. Anton and Ischgl for Austria’s best party atmosphere. James Bond fans will also recognise Sölden from the 2015 film <em>Spectre</em> and, this winter, a new cinematic experience, <em>007 Elements</em>, will entertain visitors on the summit of Gaislachkogl.            <br /><strong>Stay seven nights on half board at the three-star superior <u>Hotel Sölderhof</u> from £839 per person based on two sharing. Price includes return flights and airport transfers. V</strong><strong>isit </strong><strong>www.inghams.co.uk/ski</strong><strong> or call </strong><strong>01483 791 114.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>La Clusaz, France</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just a convenient, one-hour transfer from Geneva airport, the pretty Savoyard village of La Clusaz is a family-friendly resort with excellent terrain for beginners. The ski area (210km) is formed of five interlinked mountains, which offer a great range of confidence-building green and blue runs. The village itself is chilled out but fun, with plenty of activities: it’s one of the few French resorts where guests can go ski joëring – a rare opportunity to be pulled along by a horse. It’s also renowned for its Full Moon ski events whereby, a couple of times a season, the slopes stay open until 1am for night skiing. Inghams offers self-catering, bed and breakfast and half board accommodation options. A non-ski kindergarten is also available locally.       <br /><strong>Stay seven nights self-catering at the four-star <u>Résidence Les Grandes Alpes</u> from £599 per person based on eight sharing. Price includes return flights and airport transfers. V</strong><strong>isit </strong><strong>www.inghams.co.uk/ski</strong><strong> or call </strong><strong>01483 791 114.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Samoëns, France</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Charming Samoëns is a beautifully-preserved historic village within France’s fourth largest interlinked ski area: the Grand Massif (265km). There couldn’t be a better resort for self-catering guests, as a weekly Savoyard market sells French breads, wines and cheeses, whilst great-value restaurants offer hearty meals and boutique bakeries entice guests in for delicious delicacies. A family lift pass is available (two adults and two children aged five - 15) to pre-book through Inghams from £735, adding value to any family ski holiday. Whilst the skiing is varied and suitable for all levels, there are plenty of non-ski activities too, such as ice-skating, dog sledding, fat biking, hot air balloon rides and yoga classes.                 <br /><strong>Stay seven nights self-catering at the four-star <u>La Reine des Prés Apartments</u> from £509 per person based on ten sharing. Price includes return flights and airport transfers. V</strong><strong>isit </strong><strong>www.inghams.co.uk/ski</strong><strong> or call </strong><strong>01483 791 114.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Courmayeur, Italy</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Stylish and sophisticated, Courmayeur (in Aosta Valley) is a favourite with fashionable Italians and boasts iconic skiing (100km) in the shadow of Mont Blanc, best-suited to intermediates. Competent skiers who enjoy off-piste can tackle the famous 22km Vallée Blanche (recommended with a guide) into Chamonix, France, from the top of the ultra-modern Mont Blanc Skyway gondola, which featured prominently in 2017’s spy-flic <em>Kingsman: The Golden Circle</em>, starring Colin Firth. The town’s network of high-end shops and excellent restaurants are linked by pretty cobbled streets, and a thermal spa can be enjoyed after skiing in nearby Pré St. Didier.   <br /><strong>Stay seven nights on half board at the four-star <u>Hotel Gran Baita</u> from £969 per person based on two sharing. Price includes return flights and airport transfers. V</strong><strong>isit </strong><strong>www.inghams.co.uk/ski</strong><strong> or call </strong><strong>01483 791 114.</strong></p>
