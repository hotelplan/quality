<p>Created by Feefo, Trusted Service is awarded only to businesses that use Feefo to collect genuine reviews and insights. Businesses who meet the high standard, based on the number of reviews they have collected and their average rating, receive the award. A highly valued badge of approval, this accreditation remains unique, as it is based purely on interactions with real customers. As all reviews are verified as genuine, the accreditation is a true reflection of a business’s commitment to outstanding service.<br /><br />Feefo gives Platinum Trusted Service awards to businesses that have achieved the Feefo Gold standard for three consecutive years or more. Inghams the expert ski and Lapland specialists, continue to offer their customers excellent service across a wide range of winter holiday options in Europe and Canada. While the Inghams summer programme provides an exciting choice of wellness breaks, escorted and self-guided tours, city breaks, tailor-made holidays in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/tours-multi-centres/tours-multi-centres-in-italy">Italy</a>, walking and cycling trips and more in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/austria">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/tours-multi-centres/tours-multi-centres-in-canada">Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/france">France</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/germany">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/italy-holidays">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/norway">Norway</a>, <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/slovenia">Slovenia</a> and <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/switzerland">Switzerland</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams CEO, Joe Ponte said:<br /></strong> <br />“It’s fantastic to receive the Platinum Trusted Service Award from Feefo because it’s based on the feedback of real customers, who are the most important judges of all. At Inghams we’re really proud of the quality and service we offer on a wide range of ski, summer and Lapland holidays to suit our customer’s passions and interests—and it’s great that the travelling public recognise our commitment to providing them with the highest quality of service.<br /><br />What’s more, we are particularly honoured to have received such positive feedback from our customers following the year we’ve all just had. Throughout the pandemic we have looked to continue to do the right thing and provide the same excellent service our customers know us for. This includes offering refunds or the chance to move bookings to a later date on holidays we’ve suspended due to Covid-19, and keeping our customers up to date with the ever changing situation. We’re so pleased our customers feel that we have delivered on the high standards they expect from us and know they can book and travel with us with confidence.”<br /><br />Congratulating Inghams on winning this year’s award, Steph Heasman, Director of Customer Success at Feefo, commented:</p>
<p>“The Trusted Service award has always been about recognising companies that are outstanding in customer experience and generate great feedback from happy customers.<br /><br />This year, despite the incredible challenges of a global pandemic, so many companies using Feefo have continued to provide remarkably high levels of service and they deserve a huge amount of credit for what they have achieved. It’s why we have changed our criteria to be fair to the organisations that have struggled in such difficult circumstances. At Feefo we help our clients give their customers the best experiences possible.<br /><br />I’m confident that throughout 2021 we’ll see even greater customer experience achievements from our partners as we return to something like business-as-usual.”<br /><br />In normal times, the Feefo Gold Trusted Service award recognises organisations that have collected at least 50 Feefo reviews in a year and have achieved a service rating of at least 4.5. This year, to avoid penalising businesses suffering unduly from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the criteria has been adjusted. Organisations that won a Gold Trusted Service award last year but struggled to achieve the required number of reviews this year, have been assessed on an average rating over the 24-month period covering 2020 and 2019.<br /><br /><strong>-Ends-<br /></strong><br /><strong>Feefo Information<br /></strong><br />Feefo is a disruptive global technology company empowering brands to make smarter decisions and improve consumer experiences by leveraging the full potential of real customer reviews.<br /><br />Feefo’s cutting-edge review platform is trusted by more than 3,500 brands including Next, Vauxhall, Iceland, Mazda, Expedia, Michael Page and JCB, who rely on it to supply smart insights that transform their ability to market, sell and build more rewarding relationships with customers.<br /><br />A trusted partner of Google, Feefo’s technology and consultancy team possesses unique expertise and business insight, enabling brands to employ cutting-edge innovation that optimises the delivery of digital marketing and advertising.<br /><br />Please visit: www.feefo.com<br /><br /><strong>Inghams’ Company Information<br /></strong><br />Inghams was founded by Walter Ingham in 1934, born out of his enduring passion for ski, mountaineering and walking.<br /><br />Today, Inghams offers ski holidays in the winter to 77 resorts in 8 countries, plus winter wonderland and Santa Breaks to Lapland, with flights from 15 UK regional airports.
