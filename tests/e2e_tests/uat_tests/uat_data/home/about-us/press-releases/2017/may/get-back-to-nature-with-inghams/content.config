<p>To coincide with National Walking Month this May, as well as the start of Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains’ summer season, the specialist tour operator is encouraging guests to get ‘back to nature’ and book a walking holiday to Switzerland, where glaciers, forests, flower-filled meadows, soaring mountains, glistening lakes and raging waterfalls provide a paradise for nature-lovers. According to Inghams, May is the ideal time to book a late summer getaway to the Swiss mountains, as availability still offers excellent choice.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get ‘Back To Nature’</span></p>
<p>Mountains instead of meetings, wildlife instead of Wi-Fi, cabins instead of computers: the Swiss countryside offers refreshing summer adventures for those in search of a genuine breath of fresh air, far from the hustle and bustle of life back at home. Across the country, an extensive network of walking trails suitable for all levels is well served by the lifts at mountain towns and villages.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inghams Resorts In Switzerland</span></p>
<p>Inghams is encouraging people to get active in the Alps and discover Switzerland’s unrivalled, dramatic scenery from the top of peaks or the shores of crystal-clear lakes on a peaceful yet invigorating getaway. Inghams’ wide range of resorts offer endless opportunities to explore nature’s most magical creations on foot and, in many, Inghams guests can receive a FREE Resort Card, which entitles them to unlimited travel on the local trains and buses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascona, Lake Maggiore</li>
</ul>
<p>Situated in the foothills of the Swiss Alps and bordering Italy, the region of Ticino enjoys a warm climate and is home to Ascona, the ‘Pearl of Lake Maggiore’. The quaint town is just a pleasant one-hour stroll along the lakeside to neighbouring Locarno, whilst hikers can find more challenging alpine adventures in the hills of the Verzasca Valley, rewarded with typical Ticino scenery and cool air.</p>
<p>New for summer 2017, Inghams is offering a seven night holiday on a half board basis at the four-star Romantik Hotel Castello Seeschloss, including return flights and rail transfers, from £1,309 per person in September.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interlaken</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Gateway to the Jungfrau region’, Interlaken is set between the sparkling waters of lakes Thun and Brienz and is surrounded by snow-capped peaks. With two railway stations and regular boat services on both lakes, it’s easy to explore above and beyond Interlaken. Inghams excursions include the famous Schynige Platte Alpine Garden, the now-much-faster train to Jungfraujoch – Top of Europe (Europe’s highest railway station at 3,454m), and the James Bond Schilthorn.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a seven night holiday on a half board basis at the three-star Hotel Sonne, including return flights and rail transfers, from £889 per person in September.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucerne</li>

<p>This historic city on the shores of Lake Lucerne is an excellent base for venturing into the surrounding mountains of Rigi, Stanserhorn and Pilatus, all of which offer great scope for walking and unforgettable panoramic views across the lake. Rigi, rich in flora, boasts over 100km of well-marked trails suitable for all levels. Discover the ‘Flower Path’, which runs from Rigi Kaltbad to Staffel and has signs which explain the variety of wild flowers found along the route. Inghams recommends pre-booking the Tell Pass regional travel and walking pass for exploring Lake Lucerne and further afield.</p>

<p>Located in the heart of the Jungfrau Region, home to a tremendous range of walking opportunities, Grindelwald sits at the foot of the towering, impressive north face of the Eiger. With its dramatic glaciers in full view, the iconic Eiger can be closely explored on the ‘Eiger Trail’, which runs along the base of the North Wall, past gushing streams and jagged rock formations. Inghams recommends pre-booking the Jungfrau Travel Pass for unlimited use of mountain transport in the region and Interlaken, including boat trips on lakes Thun and Brienz.</p>
