<p>Specialist European tour operator Inghams is introducing a number of exciting new additions to its Lakes &amp; Mountains programme for summer 2017. Along with three newly-opened French hotels and four new Italian destinations, highlights include three brand new holiday options: ‘Lakes &amp; Peaks’, which combines Austria and Germany, a ‘Treasures of Tuscany’ small group tour, and ‘Cycling Adventure Week’ in Morzine, France.</p>
<p>The newly expanded Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains programme features over 100 top resorts, cities and tours across Europe, with direct flights from 23 local UK airports. Inghams guests can now enjoy more savings, special offers and flexibility, choosing from short breaks, week-long trips or longer stays of ten, 11 or 14 nights, as well as twin-centre holidays.</p>
<p><strong>NEW ‘CYCLING ADVENTURE WEEK’ IN MORZINE</strong><br />Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains’ first ever ‘Cycling Adventure Week’ will run from Saturday 1st – Saturday 8th July 2017 and offers cycling enthusiasts a chance to climb mountains and take in Morzine’s breathtaking scenery with a professional guide.
