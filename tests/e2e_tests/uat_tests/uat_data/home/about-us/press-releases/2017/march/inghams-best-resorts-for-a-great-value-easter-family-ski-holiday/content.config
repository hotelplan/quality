<p>With heavy snowfall expected across the Alps at the end of March, the first couple of weeks in April look set to be blessed with fantastic ski conditions. The end of the ski season tends to bring generally milder weather, meaning more blue skies, longer lunches in the sun and longer days. Great value packages are also up for grabs at this time of year. All in all, it’s no wonder skiers often opt for a late season holiday! With ski resorts starting to wind down and slopes beginning to empty, the Easter holidays can be one of the best times of year to take young children skiing and for beginners to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Best resort for Easter festivities: Tignes</strong> <br />Part of the superb Espace Killy ski area, which links up to Val d’Isère, Tignes boasts some of the best skiing in Europe and is especially good for late season trips due to its high altitude (2100m). During the Easter holidays, the resort puts on a range of fun-filled activities for children, including the Tignes Easter Egg Hunt, which takes place in Tignes les Brévières), Tignes le Lac and Tignes Val Claret on Easter Sunday. The resort also puts on street theatre with local favourite characters Maurice and Jules.</p>

The resort has two designated beginner ski areas with free lifts, allowing skiers to learn and progress in a comfortable beginner environment.

<p><strong>Best resort for families with young children: Les Deux Alpes</strong> <br />It’s not easy looking after small children on holiday, particularly a ski holiday, with younger children often not wanting to ski for the whole day and parents having to limit their own ski time to take care of them. Les Deux Alpes offers families top quality childcare from just six months old and nursery for kids aged four plus, so parents can have some time to themselves on the slopes. The village itself is a compact community located on a plateau, so it’s easy to walk everywhere, even with a pushchair. The resort also offers a variety of non-ski activities including a swimming pool, ice rink, ice karting and bowling with special lanes for small children. Every week, the tourist office organises free entertainment for children such as painting, ice sculpting, dancing and evening shows.</p>

Families can spend the day skiing together in the fabulous Espace Killy ski area which has especially good, snow sure, late season skiing including the Glacier Du Pisaillas, and then go their separate ways in the evening to explore the bars and restaurants in resort.</p>
