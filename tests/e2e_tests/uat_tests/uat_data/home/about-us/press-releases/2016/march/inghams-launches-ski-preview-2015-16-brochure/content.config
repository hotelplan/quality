  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Specialist ski holiday company Inghams has launched its Ski Preview 15/16 brochure with prices held at winter 14/15 levels and a new programme giving customers a choice of <a href="/{localLink:fada7995-e093-4f18-81c5-bdee827ee448}" title="Ski Resorts">91</a> <a href="/{localLink:fada7995-e093-4f18-81c5-bdee827ee448}" title="Ski Resorts">resorts across nine destinations</a>. Notable updates to the Inghams offering for winter 2015/16 include <a href="/{localLink:ce5fccfc-62de-4583-9ae9-c4bede80998c}" title="Rail">new overnight train travel to the Alps</a> giving guests eight days skiing for the price of six while in Austria the <a href="/{localLink:b7ea2b51-e358-4c00-a7ed-eb1e82dde9d0}" title="Hotel Edelweiss &amp; Gurgl">luxury Hotel Edelweiss and Gurgl in Obergurgl</a> is now exclusively available in the UK to Inghams customers.</p>
<p>The Preview brochure which can be viewed online here has been slimmed down to 172 pages, reflecting a more concise reader experience while every main resort and hotel from the 14/15 ski programme is still featured.</p>
<p>Executive Director, Hugh Walton says, ‘We are delighted to have this programme ready for early bookers so soon. Many of our guests like to get their ski trip booked well in advance, especially <a href="/{localLink:9b732040-9bb0-4d6a-9b9a-8c5e3e1aa3f2}" title="Group Ski Holidays">groups</a>, and we have ensured that these holidays are on sale to make this easy and convenient. To have top hotels like the Hotel Edelweiss &amp; Gurgl in Obergurgl on an exclusive basis in the UK market is a real feather in our cap, and demonstrates yet again that Inghams is most hotels’ operator of choice’.</p>
<p>Key features of the Ski Preview 15/16 brochure include:</p>
<p>Prices Frozen on Inghams Ski Holidays:<br />Prices for next winter (Dec 2015 to April 2016) have been held at winter 14/15 levels for another year for tens of thousands of holidays. The move comes following a strengthening pound and favourable negotiations with local suppliers. For the same reason, spending whilst on holiday will come down, typically, by around £90 per couple per week.</p>
<p>A huge choice of 91 Resorts, nine Countries:</p>
<p>Inghams new programme includes 91 resorts in nine countries, and features a new <a href="/{localLink:6955b036-f38f-4923-a81f-720c39770a52}" title="Chalet Hotel Le Curling">Chalet Hotel in Tignes, in the Espace Killy ski area</a>. The Chalet Hotel Curling sleeps up to 62 guests, and has an enviable position in Val Claret, Tignes, a short walk to the nearest lifts. It is home to Inghams’ new bar, the TiBar, already making an impact on the après-ski scene, with live music and sports most night. Sample price: From £535 per person including return flights, transfers and seven nights’ catered board departing in December 2015.</p>
<p>Eight ski days for the price of six:</p>
<p>Also new is a train service to the Alps, providing a full 8-days’ skiing in a one week holiday! Depart on Friday night from London St. Pancras, then return overnight on the following Saturday. Arriving in resort at breakfast time, guests can ski as soon as they arrive and on the second Saturday, whilst all the other guests are on their way back to the airport, rail guests have another full day on the uncrowded slopes, as the return train does not leave until late evening. Inghams will provide eight days ski/board and boot hire for the price of six, and a <a href="/{localLink:f8f0ffca-ba57-48c1-ad52-a5ba5f479392}" title="Ski Lift Passes">seven day lift pass</a> for the price of six days.

<p>Lowest Brochure Price Promise<br />Inghams promise that the prices shown in the Ski 15/16 Preview brochure will be the lowest brochure prices available, and, in the unlikely case of prices reducing further, existing clients will see the price of their holiday reduce automatically. What’s more,<br />there is a ‘Lift Pass Price Guarantee’ to ensure that skiers will pay the lowest price for their lift pass.</p>
<p>Early bookers will benefit from thousands of Cash-Back offers of £50 per couple discounts, free lift passes, and freebies from partner hotels, such as free room upgrades, bar credits and activities such as sleigh rides.</p>
