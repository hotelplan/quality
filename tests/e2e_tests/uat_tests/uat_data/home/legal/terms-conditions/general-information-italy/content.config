  <bodyText><![CDATA[<h2>ACCOMODATION INFORMATION</h2>
<p><strong>Balconies/Terraces:</strong> Where a supplement has been paid for a balcony or a terrace, neither a specific view nor aspect is guaranteed. Neither should it be assumed that a balcony will include seating or a panoramic view, whether seated or not. In some cases they may be ‘Juliette’ style balconies, with limited floor space. Views from balconies, windows and terraces may be restricted by trees/foliage or other factors beyond our control and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind. The balcony or terrace may be private or shared. </p>
<p><strong>Bedrooms:</strong> The size, decor, soundproofing, style and furnishing of bedrooms can differ markedly, even within the same property. There is also considerable variation in floor space, head clearance, clothes storage facilities (sometimes very limited), types of bed and bedding. In certain locations, particularly in Austria and Switzerland, a twin is commonly accepted as referring to two separate mattresses and duvets contained in one large frame. Beds may be sofa beds or chair beds, particularly where part of the room is intended as either a sitting area or sleeping area.</p>
<p><strong>Check–in/check-out times:</strong> Your room will normally be available from 4pm onwards but please bear with the accommodation if it takes longer. Check-out times may be before 10am or before your departure from resort.</p>
<p><strong>Leisure facilities:</strong> Swimming pools, hot-tubs, spa-baths and saunas are operated and maintained by the management or owners in accordance with local regulations or guidelines. Leisure facilities may be subject to limited opening hours, and there may be restrictions on their use by children. Should any leisure facility become unavailable for any reason, we cannot guarantee being able to repair or replace it during your holiday, and do not offer compensation for inconvenience or curtailed use in such an event.</p>
<p><strong>Lifts:</strong> Please note that in some properties, lifts may not directly service all floors and access to and from these floors may be by stairway only. Not all properties have lifts.</p>
<p><strong>New-Build Projects &amp; Refurbishments:</strong> A number of our featured properties are newly built or substantially converted or refurbished for us each season, and we take every possible care with the owners to ensure that each such property is completed on schedule. Clearly however, matters outside our direct control, such as local authorities or adverse weather at critical times for example, can occasionally cause delays, and/or there may be changes to the designer’s or architect’s plans upon which we have based our description. In the event that either eventuality happens, we will advise you as soon as any impact on your holiday is clear. For more information, please see clause 5 of our Booking Conditions. No further compensation shall be payable for changes caused by late delivery of new-build or refurbished properties, or changes to architects’ or designers’ plans, and Inghams’ liability in such cases shall be limited to the provision or conversion of the above three alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Seating areas:</strong> may not typically consist of a full lounge or separate lounge area, but will normally include chair(s), a sofa or other forms of seating.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> We cannot be held responsible for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or equipment from any accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>TV:</strong> Where a TV is advertised, no guarantee is implied as to how many English-speaking channels will be available, if any, including Satellite TV.</p>
<p><strong>Views:</strong> Views may be restricted, and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind from a window, balcony or the room itself. It should not be assumed the “view” can be visible from all parts of the room, window or balcony, whether seated or standing. Views may sometimes be restricted by trees or foliage etc. and other factors beyond our control.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi/Internet Access:</strong> Where Wi-Fi or internet access is indicated in a property description, this belongs to the property and its availability is outside our control. In some more remote resorts signal strength may be limited throughout the whole resort and not just in our properties. No guarantee is given or implied that it will be operative during your holiday; you will not be advised in advance if this facility is removed, and no compensation or refund will be paid if it is not available for whatever reason. Charges may applyWe ask for your understanding and patience in remembering that the connections in the mountains are not as reliable or as strong as you may be used to in the UK. The connections will, in normal circumstances, be suitable for the checking of emails and basic web-browsing, but the downloading and streaming of films and other media may not be possible. Safe-keeping of your laptop computer/tablet/smartphone is your own responsibility, as is ensuring that it is properly insured for the circumstances above; no liability will be accepted for damage to or loss or theft of laptops from accommodation, including if your insurance company refuses to pay out for any reason. We also accept no liability for any loss of data or virus infection to  your device whilst on holiday with us, however caused.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>SPECIFIC TO HOTELS, PENSIONS AND SELF-CATERING UNITS</h2>
<p>At each of the hotel and apartment properties featured in the brochure and on our website we have an allocation of rooms/apartments at contract rates and conditions. When this allocation is full, it may be possible for us to apply for additional rooms, if we are asked to do so, but these may not always be offered to us at ‘contract’ rates and therefore a supplement may apply. This may also occur if we are asked to obtain rooms of a type/standard not included in our normal allocation. Some partner hotels do offer a choice of smoking and non-smoking rooms. Requests for a preferred type should be made at time of booking but cannot be guaranteed. Some of the properties featured may also be petfriendly. Whilst we do not offer pet-friendly holidays, private guests or guests booked with other tour operators may have the right to bring their<br />pets to the hotel. If you have a pet allergy, you should discuss this with whoever you book with at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Air-conditioning:</strong> even though the property may feature air-conditioning in the rooms, certain countries have strict policies on when the airconditioning is operational during the season and this is governed by local law.</p>
<p><strong>Annexes:</strong> When annexes are used, these may be directly owned and controlled by the accommodation provider or contracted in private homes. They may either be joined to the main building or be within walking distance of the accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> In apartments and self-catering apartments, it is generally accepted that a clean at the beginning of the week will occur. Your bedroom will be clean and tidy for your arrival. You will also be required to leave your apartment in a tidy state at the end of your stay and some apartments may provide an end of stay checklist to adhere to. It may also be the case that hotel rooms and all other accommodation are not cleaned on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Dimensions of rooms in hotels or apartments when quoted are approximate, and normally include the bathroom and the balcony area.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Beds:</strong> Where an extra bed is added, this may limit the space available and may be smaller than conventional sized single beds. Rooms with extra beds are still bookable for two person occupancy, although, in this case, the hotelier may allocate a standard-sized twin bedded room without extra beds. Single rooms do not always match up either in size or facilities to twin bedded rooms, even when a supplement is paid. If you require a cot, we advise you book a room that can take an extra bed, otherwise the room may feel cramped. Hotel charges for cots must be paid directly to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Free upgrade offers:</strong> Where a hotel offers ‘free’ upgrades on their rooms, these are subject to availability and may only be applicable to holidays taken in certain months of the season. The hotel may amend or withdraw this offer at any time during the season, without notice.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel leisure facilities:</strong> Some hotels, especially in Italy require you to wear a “bathing” cap whilst using the pool facilities.<br />Some hotels adopt a ‘no swimwear’ rule in respect of their sauna areas. Please note, each hotel has its own policy on this rule, which is subject to change without notice. In hotels with spas or wellness centres, massages/beauty treatments will normally be provided by the hotel’s own wellness area staff, but in some cases will be available to book through the hotel with a visiting provider of these services. Services provided by the accommodation: Where the accommodation provider offers a service such as childcare or kindergarten facilities, these services are offered and available for use by guests entirely at their own risk. There is no guarantee that the services offered will be equivalent to a UK standard and they may differ from the description of the facility published at the time. </p>
<p><strong>Meal Arrangements:</strong> If you book half board, the first meal you will receive will usually be dinner on the day of your arrival in the resort and the last meal will be breakfast on the morning of your departure from the resort. No drinks are included on a half board option (unless stipulated). Clients arriving late at a hotel will normally receive a cold meal. At peak times, some hotels may choose to seat clients together on larger tables. “All Inclusive” hotels include breakfast, a light lunch, evening meals and unlimited drinks in the basic holiday price (although set times and choices may apply at some hotels). Where packed lunches are provided as part of your accommodation stay, they will not be provided on the day of departure. Please note, some hotels can charge for tap water, or may only offer bottled water at an applicable charge.</p>
<p><strong>Mezzanine levels:</strong> Where mezzanine levels are described, they may be accessible by steep stairs and will typically be under the eaves in most units or hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Star Ratings/Country Standards:</strong> Official star ratings, where available, are shown at the foot of the price panel and on the property description page on our website. They are primarily intended to give a guide to the range of facilities and services available in each property. As you would expect, 2 and 3 star properties generally have a more limited range of facilities and services than is available in 4 and 5 star properties. We also show our own Inghams rating of each property alongside the property name and above its description. These ratings are based on our own inspections of properties as well as on customer feedback as expressed in our questionnaires.</p>
<p>Our star rating is indicated by a green “star” ranging from HHH to HHHHH. In some cases we award an additional half star where we believe a hotel offers better facilities and services than its official rating would suggest. Conversely we may have downgraded a hotel to give a truer representation of the services and facilities offered. In general the overall standard of services and facilities varies significantly from country to country within star categories. For example, an officially rated 4 star property may only possess 3 star standards (and vice versa) despite having an extensive range of services and facilities. This is because of the many different criteria that are used from country to country to assess star ratings.</p>
<p>Please note these criteria can differ significantly to those used in the UK by motoring and other organisations and UK ratings cannot therefore be compared to those used overseas. For example, few tourist authorities include an assessment of culinary performance in their ratings.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>ACCURACY OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Our package holidays and other types of holiday arrangements may also be featured on websites owned and operated by travel agents and other organisations. We have absolutely no control over the content or maintenance ofsuch sites and therefore we cannot accept any liability for information contained on them.</p>
<p>Where distance is quoted in time taken to walk, we have used as a guideline that 100mtakes an adult oneminute to walk in standard footwear under normal conditions. Clearly,timings will vary according to footwear, age, personal fitness and surface conditions. The picturesshown in the brochure and on the website are included for theirstyle and general relevance and are shown forillustration purposes and unless stated are not necessarily taken atthe resort described. Photographs of rooms are intended to give an indication of the typical appearance, but rooms (including in ‘managed by Inghams’ properties) will inevitably vary in size, furnishing and decorative style. Where free minibusservices are advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and/or be on a ‘first come, firstserved’ basis and could only run at set times, details of which are available in resort. We cannot be held responsible if you miss any, all or part of your other arrangements as a result ofthe late running or unavailability of these services.</p>
<p>Hotelplan Ltd cannot accept responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of industrial action in resort, e.g. strike action by lift operators, bus drivers, etc. Equally, where other factors such as weather impact on the availability of some resort facilities and services, including the operation of lifts, any refunds must be negotiated with the supplier.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>ADDING EXTRAS</h2>
<p>We’re delighted to be able to offer a whole host of extras to help you get the most out of your holiday with us, details of which can be found on our website and in our brochure. It’s advisable that you book any extras at the time of booking, as we cannot guarantee that they can be added later and prices can change at any time. If you add these extras after confirming your booking, you will be charged the price applicable at the time those extras are booked, not at the time the holiday itself was booked. We try wherever possible to obtain special offers and discounts from our chosen suppliers to pass on to our guests, though these are subject to availability and can be withdrawn at any time. Please ask our Reservations team about any applicable offers when confirming your booking.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CARRIAGE OF BICYCLES AND SPORTING EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>Please enquire at time of booking as charges will usually apply. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CHILD DISCOUNTS</h2>
<p>Except where stated, child FREE and discounted places are based on the child/children sharing the room with at least two full-paying guests. A maximum of two discounted child places (including a FREE place if applicable) is permitted per room/suite/cabin/apartment.</p>
<p>• FREE places are limited to one per booking. FREE places and child discount percentages are calculated off the basic adult brochure price shown in the relevant price panel, not including room or flight supplements, insurance or any other applicable costs.<br />• Children on self-drive or accommodation-only holidays receive the same percentage discounts shown for European charter flights off the relevant adult basic self-drive or accommodation-only price.<br />• Only one FREE child place is allowed per group claiming a Group Discount.<br />• Infants under 2 years of age on the return travel date to the UK pay an Infant Administration Fee as shown below, provided that the infant travels on a parent’s lap, and no flight, coach or train seat is used:<br />- £49 (when using charter flights) in European hotels and apartments, with direct payment to the accommodation owner of any cot-hire and linen charges, food and drink costs or other applicable charges (£99 on scheduled flights).<br />• Please note that infants do not have their own luggage allowance, and must sit on a parent’s lap on the flight and on the transfers.<br />• Child prices and FREE places cannot be combined with online discounts.<br />• The child reductions shown in the brochure are correct at the time of going to press, but may be changed or withdrawn at any time. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• If dual parent families abuse our single parent discounts, we reserve the right to either cancel such bookings without notice or to re-invoice the booking at the correct price.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IN RESORT</h2>
<p>We provide the services of a local Inghams Representative, who will either be based in the resort, provide a visiting service, or be available by telephone. If you require any assistance during your stay, please get in touch with your Representative, whose details will be available in your Welcome Pack and/or on arrival at your accommodation.</p>
<p>Parents are reminded that children must remain under their control at all times. Age limits or qualifications may apply to several activities and it may be that a basic or reasonable level of fitness is required to partake in a certain activity or a requirement of swimming to take part in water-based activities. On occasion, passport evidence may also be required. Our Reservations Team has full details and you should enquire before booking if any limitations to activities are of paramount importance to you. No guarantee is given as to the specific length or time duration of each activity and some activities will require excess payments to be made for insurance purposes to partake in that activity. Each specific supplier will provide more details in resort. Minimum numbers and/or suitable weather conditions are required for certain activities to take place.</p>
<p>If the required numbers are not reached, ort he weather prevents the activity taking place at all during your holiday, or the activity is withdrawn by the provider for any reason, any refunds must be negotiated directly with the provider and cannot be guaranteed by us as we act as an agent and are not responsible for the provision of the service or activity normally. Some excursions are subject to minimum numbers. It may also be the case that excursions do not start directly from the resort you are booked to stay in, and you may incur additional charges in travelling to the excursion departure point. Excursions can also be shared between resorts and the point of origin may not be from your resort.</p>
<p>No refunds or compensation will be paid by the service providers if you simply change your mind about taking part in an activity after booking it, or miss the transport provided, or fail to arrive at the designated meeting point on time, or, in your or the provider’s judgment, cannot physically cope with the activity. (If the latter is due to a physical injury, you should claim under your travel insurance policy.)</p>
<p>Any arrangements made by you independently of our company are entirely at your own risk and you should make sure you are appropriately insured.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IN-RESORT PURCHASES</h2>
<p>Payment for excursions, optional activities, etc. booked in resort must be made at the point of booking in local currency cash, or by debit card or credit card. Card payments will be taken in sterling converted from the local currency price at the applicable exchange rate at that time. Exchange rate fluctuations may mean that the sterling price paid may not be exactly the same as the cost in local currency in your resort. Where paying with a Euro or Swiss Franc currency card, the local currency price will be debited from your account. Card payments cannot be processed after the Friday of your holiday for Saturday departures, and Tuesday for Wednesday departures, so cash payments are required for later settlement. We reserve the right to involve local police and/or deny return travel if due payments are withheld for any reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>LOST PROPERTY</h2>
<p>A report of any lost items must be made immediately to your Resort Representative if the loss is noticed while you are on holiday, including on transfers to and from resort.</p>
<p>If the item is not found and returned to you prior to your departure, you must report the loss to your Resort Representative by text or phone, using the contact details you will be provided with during your holiday. Alternatively, you can contact us by email at lostpropertyCOUNTRY@inghams.co.uk, replacing ‘COUNTRY’ with the country that you travelled to.<br />Please do give us a full description of the item lost, including any branding/distinguishing features. If found, the return of your property will carry a fee to cover the costs of returning it to you, normally €20 for small items and €50 for larger items. Additional charges may apply for the return of lost property from non-EU countries. No item will be returned unless this fee is paid in advance and arrangements for its return have been made as above.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the return of any item of lost property and our staff’s involvement in tracing it shall not constitute acceptance of any liability for the item at any stage of the process. We regret that any items of lost property found and not claimed within 28 days after the holiday end date cannot be kept and will be disposed of.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>SPECIAL REQUESTS</h2>
<p>Any special requests you have such as vegetarian or other special dietary meals, special facilities, specific room allocations or any other requirements you consider important, should be made known to us at the time of booking and advised to us promptly, in writing. If you require the fulfilment of your request to be a condition of your package holiday contract with us ,this can only be done if you advise us in writing and our providers agree they can meet your request and we confirm this back to you in writing, separately to the Confirmation Invoice. See also our Important Information with regard to dietary requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Special Medical Requirements:</strong> If you have any special/medical requirements, it is essential that you bring these to our attention at the earliest opportunity and before confirming your holiday, as some accommodation and resorts may be found to be unsuitable. It is therefore important that you provide us promptly with written details of your requirements in order that we can help you find a suitable holiday. When booking excursions or events in resort, you should ensure that the excursion or event that you have chosen is suitable and that the provider is made aware of any special requirements that you may have, in order that they may take an informed decision as to the suitability of the excursion or event for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>TRANSFERS</h2>
<p>Please see the resort pages for transfer times. These are approximate and do not include refreshment/toilet stops. The times may also be affected by weather, road and traffic conditions. In particular, congestion during continental school holidays can cause delays, as may road closures due to roadworks, etc. It may be necessary to wait for guests arriving on other flights, but we try to keep waiting time to as short a time as possible in the circumstances. Some of our twin centre holidays involve a transfer via the airport. Please ask our Reservations Team if this is important to you.</p>
<p>Transfers can be by coach, shared mini-bus, train or car. Private transfers can be arranged at a supplement – please speak to our Reservations Team for further information. “Short transfers” indicates a resort with driving times to/from the airport of 90 minutes or less in normal, undisrupted weather and traffic conditions. Transfers are not always accompanied by an Inghams Representative, though you will usually be met at your arrival airport. The transfer into resort may not stop directly outside your property and at times, a feeder may be provided (if applicable). If you require assistance to the door of your accommodation, please contact our Reservations team.</p>
<p>Although many coaches are equipped with toilets, they are not always available for use, for a variety of reasons. European coaches do not always have fitted seatbelts. Infants under the age of 2 years on the return date of travel must sit on a parent’s lap. It is not normally possible to show children’s videos on coach transfers. Some properties are not situated close to coach-accessible roads and walks from 50 to 400 metres, sometimes with gradients, are necessary on arrival and departure. Please see the property description and if this is important to you call our Reservations Team. Transfers will endeavour to drop you off directly outside your accommodation wherever possible, but there may be times where, due to adverse weather conditions or other circumstances beyond our control, this may not be possible. We will not accept liability for this and no compensation will be offered where you are required to walk some distance to your accommodation.<br />On occasions there may be waiting times for other flights to join your transfer to resort, and transfers may sometimes involve a change of vehicle en route.</p>
<p>Your return transfer coach may also carry guests from more than one flight and this may affect your departure time from resort. In the event of a flight diversion to an outbound flight for whatever reason, Inghams will endeavour to arrange coaches and staff to be at the alternative airport to meet you, but this cannot be guaranteed at short notice and we ask for your patience and understanding. No liability will be accepted if a diversion causes a delay at the arrival airport and/or a longer than advertised transfer to resort. Restrictions on drivers’ working hours can occasionally affect coach availability and may result in delays.</p>
<p>Independent Travel: Please note that you should plan to arrive at your accommodation after 4pm on arrival day and to leave by 10am on your departure day. Very few properties have parking spaces for self-drive guests and others have extremely limited spaces or no space at all. Public parking in resort is always subject to availability and will normally incur a charge which you pay locally. If arranging your own flights, it will not be possible to join Inghams’ coach transfers, and you should be aware that it can be extremely expensive to arrange transfers by taxi from your arrival airport to the resort. There will not normally be any price reduction in the event that you choose not to use our flights.</p>
<p>High Altitude Resorts: You should be aware that some people experience difficulties in high altitude resorts and it may be advisable to seek advice from your doctor before travel if you have any medical conditions which this may exacerbate.<br />Driving abroad: From 8 June 2015, the paper counterpart to the photo card driving licence will not be valid and will no longer be issued by DVLA. The counterpart was introduced to display driving licence details that could not be included on the photo card. These details include some vehicle categories you are entitled to drive and any endorsement/penalty points. For more information go to gov.uk/government/news/driving-licence-changes.</p>
<p>The outcome of Brexit may also have an impact on driving abroad, so we recommend that you check the Government website for the most up-to-date information: gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS</h2>
<p>For your own safety and that of other mountain users, please refer to the Mountain Safety information included in your Information Pack provided on your arrival in resort.</p>]]></bodyText>
