  <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>INGHAMS SKI &amp; LAPLAND GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p><strong>Adding Extras</strong><br />We’re delighted to be able to offer a whole host of extras to help you get the most out of your holiday with us, details of which can be found on our website and in our brochure. It’s advisable that you book any extras such as ski packs (if any) at the time of booking, as we cannot guarantee that they can be added later and prices can change at any time. If you add these extras after confirming your booking you will be charged the price applicable at the time those extras are booked, not at the time the holiday itself was booked. We try wherever possible to obtain special offers and discounts from our chosen suppliers to pass on to our guests, though these are subject to availability and can be withdrawn at any time. Please ask our Reservations Team about any applicable offers when confirming your booking.</p>
<p><strong>Carriage of Skis/Snowboards</strong><br />If you have your own equipment, then please do let us know when booking your holiday so that we can do our best to ensure that your skis or snowboard can be carried on your flight, as ski carriage can be limited. Some airlines require that passengers book and pay for their ski carriage directly with the airline once your holiday is confirmed with us. Our Reservations Team will be able to advise you of this.<br />Ski boots and snowboard boots are carried as part of your normal luggage allowance. Pre-booked skis/snowboard carriage on our charter flights is normally £40 return per snowboard or pair of skis, with the exception of EasyJet who can charge £70 to pre-book, and this can sometimes be up to £70 each way on scheduled flights to Europe (current price to be advised at time of booking). On long-haul flights to Canada, the charge can be in excess of £70 each way, so please do clarify this at the time of booking. Please be aware that this is per set of equipment and that ski/snowboard bags presented for carriage containing more than one pair of skis/snowboard where the appropriate charge per set of equipment has not been pre-paid will be charged for at check-in. Carriage of skis/snowboards presented for check-in at the airport without being shown as pre-booked on your confirmation invoice cannot be guaranteed and, if carried, will carry a charge payable at the airport in cash prior to check-in which can be considerably higher than the pre-booked price.<br />Some aircraft have limited capacity for skis/snowboards, and space is allocated on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. These flights do not operate a ‘pay at the airport’ alternative. No liability is accepted by Hotelplan Ltd if you do not pre-book carriage and the airline is unable to carry your equipment. There is no liability taken for airlines that may not offer to carry snowboards within their ski carriage policies.<br />If you are travelling on a scheduled flight and wish to take your own skis please enquire at the time of booking as ski carriage rules and charges vary by airline. Charges quoted are usually ‘per sector’ (i.e. a charge applies for the outbound and homebound journey). You may wish to consider pre-booking ski hire in resort instead.</p>
<p><strong>Flights</strong><br />Most of our flights operate a ‘buy on board’ service, though aircraft capacity for catering suppliers is of course limited and items can run out. We always recommend purchasing snacks and drinks inside the airport (airside), particularly if travelling with children.</p>
<p><strong>In-resort purchases</strong><br />Payment for ski-pack items, optional activities, child care, etc. booked in resort must be made at the point of booking by debit or credit card. Card payments will be taken in Euros or in sterling, which will be converted from the local currency price at the applicable exchange rate at that time. Exchange rate fluctuations may mean that the sterling price paid may not be exactly the same as the cost in local currency in your resort. Where paying with a Euro or Swiss Franc currency card, the local currency price in addition to a handling charge will be debited from your account. <br />Any activities, excursions or ski packs that you choose to book whilst you are on holiday are not part of the package holiday provided by us. Your contract will be with the provider of the activity, excursion or ski pack and not with Hotelplan Ltd. If activities or excursions are withdrawn by the provider for any reason, any refunds must be negotiated directly with the provider and cannot be guaranteed by us as we act as an agent for the provider.</p>
<h3>Group &amp; Child Discounts</h3>
<p>We’re pleased to offer some great discounts to groups travelling together and to those travelling with children. <br />Group Discounts (https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-holiday-types/group-ski-holidays) <br />To qualify as a group, all guests must book at the same time, for the same departure date, resort and duration, and all communication and payment must be organised through one named individual as the group leader. Group members may however travel by different routes or methods, and/or occupy different price room/apartment-types.<br />• Group discount is valid on bookings with at least 10 full-price paying passengers. Discounts are based on the basic adult price after any discounts given from the hotel, not including any applicable room, meal or flight supplements, ski packs, ski/snowboard carriage, or any other ancillary costs.<br />• The group size is calculated on the number of passengers paying the full adult price quoted at time of booking. Any child with a discount does not count towards the group discount.<br />• Group discounts cannot be combined with any other offers or discounts advertised. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• Group discounts do not apply in our own-run chalet and hotel properties, on Inghams Santa Breaks, Canadian holidays, or within the following exclusion dates 23/24 Dec, 30/31 Dec, 10/11 Feb and 30/31 Mar.<br />• Later additions can be made to your group, subject to availability, but the original group discount will not be increased as a result of such additions. If your group size reduces after booking, the group discount will be reduced accordingly, and may be lost completely if all group conditions are no longer complied with, and re-costing may apply if room occupancy levels change.<br />• We have specific allocations of rooms at special Inghams rates in most hotels, and if extra rooms are required to accommodate your group, these may not be available at the same preferential rate, in which case ‘extra to allocation’ supplements may apply. If we have obtained such extra rooms to accommodate your group, we reserve the right to re-cost the holiday if your group later reduces in size.<br />• We reserve the right to amend or withdraw this offer at any time, without notice. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• The names of all group members are required at the time of booking for all scheduled flights, and any subsequent change will incur an amendment fee, or with some scheduled airlines, cancellation and re-booking. For all charter flights, names are required within 14 days of booking, but we allow free name changes up to 28 days prior to departure, after which an administration fee for any further changes will apply. For scheduled services, charges will apply for any name change.<br />• Only one invoice will normally be issued per group, to the group leader, The Group Leader is responsible for ensuring that every member of his/her group has appropriate winter sports travel insurance for their needs.<br />• A £150 deposit is required from all group members. Full payment must be made at least 10 weeks prior to departure, by debit card or credit card. <br />• We reserve the right to restrict the group discounts allowed across multiple groups in the same property on the same date at any time.<br />• All group bookings are ‘subject to availability’ and can be removed at any time, which includes respecting the right of hoteliers to decline single-sex groups or groups above a certain size.<br />• We strongly recommend pre-booking ski/snowboard carriage and ski pack requirements at the time of booking, to avoid disappointment and ensure a smooth process on arrival in resort.</p>
<p>Child Discounts (https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-holiday-types/family-ski-holidays) <br />Except where stated, child discounted places are based on the child/ren sharing the room with at least two full-paying guests. A maximum of two discounted child places is permitted per room/suite/cabin/apartment. Air Passenger Duty (APD) for children under 16 years was abolished in March 2016. This has been taken into account in the calculation of our child reductions.<br />• Child cost percentages are calculated off the basic adult selling price at the time of booking, not including room or flight supplements, ski packs, ski/board carriage, child care or any other applicable costs.<br />• Children on Self-drive or Accommodation-only holidays receive the same percentage discounts for European charter flights, off the relevant adult basic Self-drive or Accommodation-only price.<br />• As they are by definition not ‘full-paying guests’ children receiving a discount do not count<br />- towards the size of a Group for the purposes of calculating any Group Reduction<br />- towards the occupancy figure in European apartments/cabins/suites for the purposes of calculating any applicable under-occupancy supplements. (In the likely event that the under-occupancy supplements make the total family price higher with the child discount than without, we will simply cost the holiday at the adult price, and give each child (max. 2 children) a special reduction of £50 per child.<br />• Infants (i.e. under 2 years of age on the return travel date to the UK) pay an Infant Administration Fee as shown below, provided that the infant travels on a parent’s lap and no flight, coach or train seat is used:<br />• £49 in European hotels and apartments, with direct payment to the accommodation owner of any cot-hire &amp; linen charges, food &amp; drink costs or other applicable charges.<br />• £179 to Canada, on the same basis as above.<br />• £115 in our Inghams own-run chalets and Hotels, where travel-cot hire, linen, baby food, use of highchair and changing mat is included in this price<br />• Please note that infants do not have their own luggage allowance, and must sit on a parent’s lap on the flight and on the transfers.<br />• The child reductions may be changed or withdrawn at any time. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• If dual parent families abuse our single parent discounts, we reserve the right to either cancel such bookings without notice or to re-invoice the booking at the correct price.</p>
<p><strong>In Resort</strong><br />We provide the services of a local Representative, who will either be based in the resort, provide a visiting service, or be available by telephone. If you require any assistance during your stay, please get in touch with your Representative, whose details will be available in your Welcome Pack and/or on arrival at your accommodation.</p>
<p>Some activities rely on satisfactory levels of snow and/or ice and should the levels be inappropriate, providers will do their best to offer alternative activities. Parents are reminded that children must remain under their control at all times. Age limits or qualifications apply to several activities, e.g. a full driving licence is often required and must be produced on request before driving snowmobiles, and passport evidence may be required. Our Reservations Team have full details and you should enquire before booking if any limitations to activities are of paramount importance to you. Strict drink-driving laws apply to snowmobile driving, as with any vehicle. No guarantee is given as to the specific length or time duration of each activity and some activities will require excess payments to be made for insurance purposes to partake in that activity. Each specific supplier will provide more details in resort.</p>
<p>Minimum numbers and/or suitable weather conditions are required for certain activities to take place. If the required numbers are not reached, or the weather prevents the activity taking place at all during your holiday, or the activity is withdrawn or changed by the provider for any reason, any refunds must be negotiated directly with the provider and cannot be guaranteed by us as we act as an agent and are not responsible for the provision of the service or activity normally. No refunds or compensation will be paid by the service providers if you simply change your mind about taking part in an activity after booking it, or miss the transport provided, or fail to arrive at the designated meeting point on time, or if, in your or the provider’s judgement, you cannot physically cope with the activity. (If the latter is due to a physical injury, you should claim under your travel insurance policy.)</p>
<p>Any arrangements made by you independently of our company are entirely at your own risk and you should make sure you are appropriately insured.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Special Requests</strong><br />Any special requests you have such as vegetarian or other special dietary meals, special facilities, specific room allocations or any other requirements you consider important, should be made known to us at the time of booking and advised to us promptly, in writing. If you require the fulfilment of your request to be a condition of your package holiday contract with us, this can only be done if you advise us in writing and our providers agree they can meet your request and we confirm this back to you in writing, separately to the Confirmation Invoice. See also our Important Information with regard to dietary requirements.</p>
<p>Special/Medical Requirements: If you have any special/medical requirements, it is essential that you bring these to our attention at the earliest opportunity and before confirming your holiday, as some accommodation and resorts may be found to be unsuitable. It is therefore important that you provide us promptly with written details of your requirements in order that we can help you find a suitable holiday. When booking excursions or events in resort, you should ensure that the excursion or event that you have chosen is suitable and that the provider is made aware of any special requirements that you may have, in order that they may take an informed decision as to the suitability of the excursion or event for you.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Property</strong><br />A report of any lost item must be made immediately to your Resort Representative if the loss is noticed whilst you are on holiday, including on transfers to and from resort. <br />If the item is not found and returned to you prior to your departure, you must report the loss to your Resort Representative by text or phone, using the contact details you will be provided with during your holiday. Alternatively, you can contact us by email at lostpropertyCOUNTRY@inghams.co.uk, replacing ‘COUNTRY’ with the country that you travelled to. <br />Please do give us a full description of the item lost, including any branding/distinguishing features. <br />If found, you will need to arrange collection by courier at your expense. This is due to increased customs charges both in the UK and abroad. Our overseas team will package your item securely and assist with arranging for collection from an appropriate overseas address, for which a €15 admin fee will be payable. It may be possible for some smaller items to be returned to the UK by staff on overseas visits, though this is not guaranteed. <br />We cannot guarantee the return of any item of lost property and our staff’s involvement in tracing it shall not constitute acceptance of any liability for the item at any stage of the process, particularly if arrangements have not been made via our UK office as above. We regret that any items of lost property found and unclaimed 28 days after the holiday end date cannot be kept and will be disposed of.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy of Information</strong><br />Our package holidays and other types of holiday arrangements may also be featured on websites owned and operated by travel agents and other organisations. We have absolutely no control over the content or maintenance of such sites and therefore we cannot accept any liability for information contained on them.</p>
<p>The pictures shown on the Inghams website are included for their style and general relevance and are shown for illustration purposes and unless stated are not necessarily taken at the resort described. Photographs of rooms are intended to give an indication of the typical appearance, but rooms particularly within our own-run chalets and Hotels will inevitably vary in size, furnishing and decorative style, particularly where there has been partial refurbishment.</p>
<p>Where free minibus/ski-bus services are advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and / or be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis and could only run at set times, details of which are available in resort. We cannot be held responsible if you miss any, all or part of your ski lessons or other arrangements as a result of the late running or unavailability of these services.</p>
<p>Where a resort is described as being at high altitude or with “guaranteed snow”, this describes a resort with skiing over 2000 metres on its area lift pass and with a history of reliable skiing, but does not mean that skiable snow is guaranteed on all runs and all altitudes at all times or on the slopes of that individual resort. Where accommodation is described as offering “doorstep skiing” or “ski-in/ski-out” this is obviously subject to individual skiers’ ability and snow conditions in resort. This is generally defined as being possible to ski to/from a point within 50m of that property, but may be obstructed by paths or foliage. We cannot be held liable if the local authorities and/or local property owners, including the owner of the property in which you are staying, make changes to the property or surrounding area which affect the use of the intended ski in/ski out route. Where distance is quoted in time taken to walk, we have used as a guideline that 100m takes an adult one minute to walk in standard footwear under snow and ice-clear conditions. Timings will vary according to footwear, age, personal fitness and surface conditions.</p>
<p>Hotelplan Ltd cannot accept responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of industrial action in resort e.g. strike action by lift operators, bus drivers, ski schools etc. Equally, where other factors such as weather or other force majeure events affect the availability of some resort facilities and services. Advertisements and descriptions of resort facilities in Hotel and chalet information folders are not intended to be recommendations.</p>
<p>Star Ratings, where available, are shown on our website. Where official ratings are not available, we show our own Inghams rating of each property alongside the property name and above its description. These ratings are based on our own inspections of properties as well as on customer feedback as expressed in our questionnaires and indicated by a white star rating from HH to HHHHH. Properties in Finnish Lapland do not have official ratings, but have been assessed by us.</p>
<p><strong>Transfers</strong> <br />Please see the resort pages for transfer times. These are approximate and do not include refreshment/toilet stops. The times may also be affected by weather, road and traffic conditions. Please ensure that you are prepared for your transfer with adequate snacks, water, etc. and that you have used the facilities before leaving the airport, as WCs on coaches are not always available for use. Congestion during continental school holidays can cause delays, as may road closures due to roadworks, avalanche risks, etc. We ask for your understanding accordingly if, faced with forecasts of heavy snow and/or heavy holiday traffic, we need to arrange your homeward transfer earlier than normal to allow extra time to reach the airport.</p>
<p>European coaches do not always have fitted seatbelts. Infants under the age of 2 years on the return date of travel must sit on a parent’s lap. It is not normally possible to show children’s videos on coach transfers.</p>
<p>On arrival at your overseas airport, our coaches will be parked in the coach park as near as possible to the terminal buildings, though this can sometimes be a short walk away. While we do have Representatives at the airport, they are not able to assist guests with their luggage, so please do bear this in mind.</p>
<p>Some properties are not situated close to coach-accessible roads and walks from 50 to 400 metres, sometimes with gradients, are necessary on arrival and departure. Please see the property description and if this is important to you call our Reservations Team. Transfers will endeavour to drop you off directly outside your accommodation wherever possible, but there may be times where, due to adverse weather conditions or other circumstances beyond our control, this may not be possible.</p>
<p>On occasions there may be waiting times for other flights to join your transfer to resort, and transfers may sometimes involve a change of vehicle en route. Your return transfer coach may also carry guests from more than one flight and this may affect your departure time from resort. In the event of a flight diversion to an outbound flight for whatever reason, Hotelplan Ltd will endeavour to arrange coaches and staff to be at the alternative airport to meet you, but this cannot be guaranteed at short notice and we ask for your patience and understanding. If you have provided us with a mobile contact telephone number that we can use in the event of delays and diversions to travel, we will do our best to keep you updated in this manner. No liability will be accepted if a diversion causes a delay at the arrival airport and/or a longer than advertised transfer to resort. Restrictions on drivers’ working hours can occasionally affect coach availability and may result in delays. Our transfers will not always be escorted by a member of Inghams staff.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Travel</strong> <br />Very few properties have parking spaces for self-drive guests and others have extremely limited spaces or no space at all. Public parking in resort is always subject to availability and will normally incur a charge which you pay locally. If arranging your own flights, it will not be possible to join Inghams’ coach transfers, and you should be aware that it can be extremely expensive to arrange transfers by taxi from your arrival airport to the resort. There will not normally be any price reduction in the event that you choose not to use our flights.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION INFORMATION FOR HOTELS, PENSIONS &amp; SELF-CATERING UNITS</strong><br />At each of the hotel and apartment properties featured in this brochure we have an allocation of rooms/apartments at contract rates and conditions. When this allocation is full, it may be possible for us to apply for additional rooms if we are asked to do so, but these may not always be offered to us at ‘contract’ rates and therefore a supplement may apply. This may also occur if we are asked to obtain rooms of a type/standard not included in our normal allocation. Some partner hotels do offer a choice of smoking and non-smoking rooms. Requests for a preferred type should be made at time of booking but cannot be guaranteed. Some of the properties featured may also be pet-friendly. Whilst we do not offer pet-friendly holidays, private guests or guests booked with other tour operators may have the right to bring their pets to the hotel. If you have a pet allergy, you should discuss this with whoever you book with at the time. <br />a) Bedrooms: The size, decor, soundproofing, style and furnishing of bedrooms can differ markedly, even within the same property. There is also considerable variation in floor space, head clearance, clothes storage facilities (sometimes very limited), types of bed and bedding. In certain locations, particularly in Austria and Switzerland, a twin is commonly accepted as referring to two separate mattresses and duvets contained in one large frame (an ‘Austrian’ or ‘Continental’ twin). <br />Where an extra bed is added, this may limit the space available and may be smaller than conventional sized single beds. Rooms with extra beds are still bookable for two person occupancy, although in this case the hotelier may allocate a standard-sized twin bedded room without extra beds. Single rooms do not always match up either in size or facilities to twin bedded rooms, even when a supplement is paid. If you require a cot, we advise that you book a room that can take an extra bed, otherwise the room may feel cramped. Hotel charges for cots must be paid directly to the hotel. <br />Where mezzanine levels are described, they may be accessible by steep stairs and will typically be under the eaves in most units or hotels.<br />b) Occupancy: As they are by definition not full-paying guests, children receiving a child discount do not count:<br />1) Towards the size of a group for the purposes of calculating any group reduction<br />2) Towards occupancy figures in European apartments, cabins or suites for the purpose of calculating any applicable under-occupancy supplements. (In the unlikely event that the under-occupancy supplements make the total family price higher with the child discounts than without, we will simply cost the holiday at the adult price and give each child (maximum two children) a special reduction of £50.00 per child).<br />Specific to Canada: Most rooms have two double beds and, in many cases, hotels allow up to four person occupancy in these rooms. This arrangement may not be suitable for four adults but represents good value for parents who do not mind sharing with their children. Some hotels have rooms of the same category with either one double bed for two persons, or two double beds for two to four persons. Where this is the case, prices are based on four persons sharing a room with two beds and supplements are payable for two persons in a room. The two person occupancy supplement will usually be the same for a room with one double bed as for a room with two double beds.<br />Specific to Lapland Cabins: Due to the varying styles of cabin, many will vary in size – including those that are provided within the same category. As a result, the sharing supplement is calculated based on the number of people occupying the cabin, and not by the number of beds available. It should therefore not be confused with a traditional under-occupancy charge (as discussed above). As with most supplements, this charge is non-refundable.<br />b) Check –in/check-out times: Your room will normally be available from 4pm onwards but please bear with the accommodation if it takes longer. Check-out times may be before 10am or before your departure from resort. <br />c) Cleaning: In apartments and self-catering apartments, it is generally accepted that a clean at the beginning of the week will occur. Your bedroom will be clean and tidy for your arrival, otherwise its state is left to you. You will also be required to leave your apartment in a tidy state at the end of your stay and some apartments may provide an end of stay checklist to adhere to. It may also be the case that hotel rooms and other accommodations are not cleaned on a daily basis. <br />d) Balconies: Where a supplement has been paid for a balcony, neither a specific view nor aspect is guaranteed. Typically a ‘side’ view will be a view available looking out and to the side from your balcony. It should not be assumed that a balcony will include seating or a panoramic view, whether seated or not. Views may be restricted. The balcony may be private or shared and where a ground floor room is allocated, this may be a terrace rather than a balcony.<br />e) Seating areas: may not typically consist of a full lounge or separate lounge area, but will normally include chair(s), a sofa or other forms of seating.<br />f) Insurance: We cannot be held responsible for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or equipment from any accommodation. If this occurs, it is your responsibility to report it first of all to the property management and, if necessary, to the local police, who should provide you with a copy of the police report. Please note that our staff are unable to report such incidents, or obtain copies of police reports, on your behalf.<br />g) TV: Where a TV is advertised, no guarantee is implied as to how many English-speaking channels will be available, if any.<br />h) Leisure facilities: Swimming pool, hot-tub, spa-bath and sauna temperatures are determined by the management or owners in accordance with local regulations or guidelines, and may not always match guests’ expectations. Leisure facilities may be subject to limited opening hours, and there may be restrictions on their use by children. Should any leisure facility become unavailable for any reason, we cannot guarantee being able to repair or replace it during your holiday, and do not offer compensation for inconvenience or curtailed use in such an event. <br />Some hotels adopt a ‘no swimwear’ rule in respect of their sauna areas. Please note, each hotel has its own policy on this rule, which is subject to change without notice. In hotels with spas or wellness centres, massages/beauty treatments will normally be provided by the hotel’s own wellness area staff, but in some cases will be available to book through the hotel with a visiting provider of these services.<br />i) Services provided by the accommodation: where the accommodation provider offers a service such as child care or kindergarten facilities, these services are offered and available for use by guests entirely at their own risk. There is no guarantee that the services offered will be equivalent to a UK standard and they may differ from the description of the facility published at the time. <br />j) Wi-Fi/Internet Access: Where Wi-Fi or internet access is indicated in a property description, this belongs to the property and its availability is outside our control. No guarantee is given or implied that it will be operative during your holiday; you will not be advised in advance if this facility is removed, and no compensation or refund will be paid if it is not available for whatever reason. Charges may apply. In some mountain resorts, signal strength is limited throughout the village not just in individual properties. The connections will, in normal circumstances, be suitable for the checking of emails and basic web-browsing, but the downloading and streaming of films and other media may not be possible. Safe-keeping of your laptop computer/tablet/smartphone is your own responsibility, as is ensuring that it is properly insured for the circumstances above; no liability will be accepted for damage to or loss or theft of laptops from accommodation, including if your insurance company refuses to pay out for any reason. We also accept no liability for any loss of data or virus infection to your device whilst on holiday with us, however caused.</p>
<p>k) Dimensions: Dimensions of rooms in hotels or apartments when quoted are approximate, and normally include the bathroom and the balcony/terrace area.<br />l) Star Ratings/Country Standards: Official star ratings, where available, are shown within the property descriptions. In general, the overall standard of services and facilities varies significantly from country to country within star categories. This is because of the many different criteria that are used from country to country to assess star ratings. Please note that these criteria can differ significantly to those used in the UK by motoring and other organisations and UK ratings cannot therefore be compared to those used overseas. For example, few tourist authorities include an assessment of culinary performance in their ratings. We also show our own Inghams rating of each property alongside the property name and above its description. These ratings are based on our own inspections of properties as well as on customer feedback as expressed in our questionnaires. Our star rating is indicated by a coloured “star” ranging from XXX to XXXXX. In some cases we award an additional half star where we believe a hotel offers better facilities and services than its official rating would suggest. Conversely we may have downgraded a hotel to give a truer representation of the services and facilities offered. <br />m) Meal Arrangements: If you book half board, the first meal you receive will usually be dinner on the day of your arrival in the resort and the last meal will be breakfast on the morning of your departure from the resort. No drinks are included on a half board option (unless stipulated). Clients arriving late at a hotel will normally receive a cold plate. At peak times, some hotels may choose to seat clients together on larger tables. “All Inclusive” hotels include breakfast, a light lunch, evening meals and unlimited drinks in the basic holiday price (although set times and choices may apply at some hotels). Where packed lunches are provided as part of your accommodation catering, they will not be provided on the day of departure. Please note, some hotels can charge for tap water; or may only offer bottled water at an applicable charge. <br />n) Annexes: When annexes are used, these may be directly owned and controlled by the accommodation provider or contracted in private homes. They may either be joined to the main building or be within walking distance of the accommodation<br />o) Lifts: Please note that in some properties, lifts may not directly service all floors and access to and from these floors may be by stairway only. Not all properties have lifts.<br />p) Views: Views may be restricted, and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind from a window or balcony, unless expressly described. Views may sometimes be restricted by trees or foliage etc. and other factors beyond our control. It is generally accepted that a ‘side view’ allows a view looking out and to the side from the window or balcony.<br />q) Walking distances: An average walking speed of 100 metres per minute has been assumed under normal resort conditions in standard footwear. Clearly, timings will vary according to footwear, age, personal fitness and surface conditions. Where free minibus is advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and/or be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.<br />r) Free upgrade offers: Where a hotel offers ‘free’ upgrades on their rooms, these are subject to availability and may only be applicable to holidays taken in certain months of the season. The hotel may amend or withdraw this offer at any time during the season, without notice. <br />s) Where a free minibus/coach service is advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and/or be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.</p>
<p><strong>OUR OWN-RUN CHALETS &amp; HOTELS</strong> <br />We’re pleased to offer an excellent choice of accommodation, including many of our own-run chalets and Hotels. These properties are run by Inghams, who employ carefully selected staff who receive comprehensive training from us. Please bear in mind that our own-run Hotels are therefore not the same as ‘Hotels’, and that they are run as larger scale chalets by Inghams employees who are not necessarily trained hospitality professionals. <br />There is no official rating system for catered chalet and our own-run Hotel accommodation, as many were not built for commercial purposes. We have introduced our own ‘diamond’ rating as a means of enabling our guests to compare our managed properties with one another. As our menus are of the same standard across our managed properties, we do not consider catering when assessing our diamond ratings.<br />Our prices reflect the standard of the accommodation you choose, but can also be influenced by location in resort, staffing ratios, transfer costs and, in particular, regional differences in rentals. <br />Accommodation will comply with any appropriate local standards of the country in which the property is situated which may differ from UK standards. Within our own-run chalets and Hotels, rooms and facilities can vary greatly, and we often find that a degree of tolerance is needed when it comes to Alpine standards of plumbing, electrics and hot water supplies. When two figures are given for the capacity of a chalet, the lower one is the normal occupancy figure, based on regular beds including sofa-beds in some cases. The higher figure allows for increased occupancy, using put-u-up beds. Neither figure includes infants occupying cots. Put-u-ups and sofa-beds may limit the space available and cause inconvenience, so please do ask our Reservations Team for advice if bedroom space is important to you. Where bunk beds are present in accommodation, they may not be comparable to standard full-size single beds.</p>

Hotel guests eat in the hotel dining room, but can swap their evening meal for a €20 credit (to be used that day) in the Evo Kitchen restaurant. There is one staff day off midweek, when only the continental breakfast is served. <br />All properties may have Inghams’ staff and/or members of the chalet owner’s family or employees living in, and may be used by Hotelplan staff as a resort office, store room or similar. Please ask for written details if this matter is important to you.<br />If separate bookings are sharing one of our own-run chalets or Hotels, we are not able to disclose any details appertaining to other guests.<br />Exclusive Use: Entire chalets or Hotels can be booked for exclusive use for your group or family. This means that no other guests will be in residence, however Inghams’ staff and/or members of the chalet owner’s family may occupy parts of the building. Please ask for written details if this matter is important to you. If you cannot fill all the advertised minimum-occupancy beds, a supplement is payable that replaces the total room under-occupancy supplements. <br />Under-occupancy: We ask you to contribute towards our loss if you reserve rooms for your exclusive use but do not fill all the beds. The supplement per empty bed payable is 40% of the basic adult air-inclusive price per empty bed space. We reserve the right to limit the number of beds left unoccupied and the number that we are able to offer at a 40% discount. The empty bed charge in the Chalet Hotel Le Savoie is 100% of the basic adult air-inclusive price. Infants occupying cots do not count towards occupancy figures.</p>
<p>a) Communal Areas<br />We endeavour to include floor plans and a floor-by-floor descriptions on our website, with the latter also available in our Accommodation Summary in our brochure. This includes an indication of the communal areas available to our guests. Seating in these areas may not typically consist of a full lounge or separate lounge area, but will normally include chair(s), a sofa or other forms of seating. Please be aware though that there may not be sufficient soft seating for every guest. <br />Some chalets may be accessed via entrances shared with other accommodations or businesses of the same owner, who may allow staff to reside on the premises. Please ask our Reservations Team if this is of importance to your booking.<br />b) Bedrooms<br />The size, decor, soundproofing and furnishing of bedrooms can differ markedly, even within the same property. There is also considerable variation in floor space, head clearance, clothes storage facilities (sometimes very limited), types of bed and bedding. In some chalets, bedrooms lead from communal rooms. Some rooms are listed as ‘under eaves’, which can at times limit head clearance by way of low beams and/or the slant of the roof. We make every effort to describe bedrooms as accurately as possible and to this end we use the term SUITE (where there are distinctly separate sleeping areas, e.g. a bedroom and separate living-room with sofa-bed) and ROOM (where all beds are in one area). We recommend that you stress special room requirements at the time of booking. Some bedrooms and suites have kitchenettes reflecting their occasional use for self-catering. They are not equipped for use and for safety reasons we disconnect most of the electrical and gas equipment. Beds may be sofa-beds or chair-beds, particularly in family accommodation where part of the room is intended as either a sleeping area or a sitting area. Twin rooms may provide an ‘Austrian twin’ or ‘Continental twin’ (i.e. a double bed frame with two single mattresses and two single duvets) in rooms described as doubles or twins. Twin beds may not always be able to be separated.<br />Balconies and Views: Where a supplement has been paid for a balcony, neither a specific view nor aspect is guaranteed, and the balcony may be private or shared. It should not be assumed that a balcony will include seating. Views from balconies and windows may be restricted by trees/foliage or other factors beyond our control and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind from a window or balcony, unless expressly described.<br />Bathroom Facilities: These will always include a bath or mini-bath or shower, but do not necessarily include toilets - please see the individual property’s ‘Accommodation Summary’ for details of each room’s precise facilities. Bathrooms may not always have full size baths and showers may not always have a shower tray or curtain.<br />When bedrooms are described as having ‘private’ facilities which are not en suite, this means the facilities are not shared with other guests, though your Chalet Host may occasionally need to use the wc and hand-washing facilities.<br />c) Catering<br />Evening meals are provided for 6 nights on a 7 night holiday, and 12 nights on a 14 night holiday. Breakfast is run on a self-service basis, normally between 8 and 9am. There is of course unlimited tea and coffee. The milk supplied is likely to be UHT. With a full quota of guests present, breakfast can get busy so a degree of patience may be needed and our staff may ask that guests stagger their arrival times for breakfast, to facilitate smoother service. For afternoon tea our staff provide a cake (and savoury treats in our own-run Hotels) daily, except on their day off, and guests should help themselves to tea and coffee. Children’s High Tea is served around 5pm and Adult dinner is served around 7:30pm. Please see the information above for each accommodation type and the catering offered, and also the individual property descriptions for details.<br />In all properties on the first evening, due to differing arrival times, the evening meal will be served at the convenience of the majority. For those on early departing transfers to the airport, only the Continental breakfast may be provided.<br />We do not permit non-guests of our chalets and own-run Hotels to dine in our properties, except under exceptional circumstances and only if agreed in writing at time of booking. Please note that, unless you have exclusive use of your chalet, dinner is strictly an adults and secondary-school age children’s occasion. Children 10 years old and under on the holiday start date are not allowed at the dinner table in our chalets, but instead are served Children’s High Tea at approximately 5pm (for further details, please see section (s) below on “Children’s High Tea”). In our own-run Hotels, children between 8 and 10 years old may eat with their parents. We cannot accept liability if we are not informed of the child’s age.<br />The consumption of duty-free and locally purchased alcohol is prohibited in the public areas of Hotels, in accordance with local licensing laws.<br />Guests are not permitted to use chalet or Hotel kitchens at any time. Further information will be provided by our resort staff. Kitchens of chalets and Hotels are not to be used to prepare daily lunches and/or an evening meal on the staff night off. This includes using any of the electrical appliances such as microwaves, cookers and dishwashers, although this list is not exhaustive. Bottle warmers for infants can be provided on request locally. Guests are asked not to remove items from the breakfast buffet for later consumption.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Special Diets &amp; Food Allergies</strong><br />If you have a serious allergy which requires a special diet to be prepared separately from other guests’ food, your booking cannot be confirmed until we have been able to confirm we can supply such a diet, even if you receive a booking confirmation invoice in the interim (see extreme food allergies below).<br />Please note that our liability in respect of Special Diets &amp; Food Allergies applies only to the chalet and Hotel accommodation that we provide, and you are advised to check with your airline as to what procedures they have in place in this regard.<br />Vegetarian meals are offered as part of the menu choice in our Hotels. In chalets we do need 14 days’ notice in writing of a request for vegetarian or vegan meals and for these to be pre-booked. <br />Other special diets (e.g. gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, low-fat/cholesterol, specific food allergies etc.) can normally be provided, but must be discussed with our Reservations Team before booking. All such dietary requests and/or food allergies must be confirmed to us in writing by email or registered post at least 14 days prior to departure. We unfortunately are unable to accept special dietary requests within 4 days prior to departure and will be unable to confirm that we can cater for your needs. <br />Food Allergy Policy: We have a well-developed Food Allergy Policy in place, with a view to avoiding any allergic reaction incidents, and shall exercise reasonable care to avoid specified food and drink ingredients if special diets are agreed at the time of booking and confirmed in writing as above. However, in choosing to travel with us, you accept the following facts:- that chalet and Hotel staff involved in catering, including for children’s meals, are generally not qualified catering professionals; that no food allergy system can ever provide a 100% guarantee against any contact with a specified foodstuff; that items such as eggs, dairy products and nuts are constantly present in chalet kitchens and dining areas, so cross-contamination cannot be ruled out; that our staff cannot police what snacks third parties, including other guests’ children, may bring into contact with the allergic person; that staff may not be aware of precise food contents (where they do not speak the language in which the ingredients are labelled, for example); that our staff cannot police lunches provided by ski-schools. We therefore cannot and do not guarantee the avoidance of specified ingredients, and cannot accept liability in the event of any dissatisfaction with special dietary arrangements, including the occurrence of an allergic reaction.<br />Extreme Food Allergies: where a food allergy is so severe that the slightest exposure to the substance in question could cause a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction (for example where a reaction may be triggered other than by actually eating the foodstuff - such as by smell alone, or by minute trace elements on the hands of a staff member or another child), you must advise us in writing of the severe nature of the allergy at the time of booking. We then reserve the right to advise you that, in our considered view, the controls we are able to implement in the family ski chalet environment are insufficient to guarantee your, or your child’s safety, in which case, should you choose to proceed with the booking, you do so entirely at your own risk, and would be asked to confirm this in writing in order to confirm the booking. If you fail to advise us of a known extreme allergy at the point of booking, you will be in breach of contract, and we will therefore have no liability to you at all in the event of any incident.<br />c) Our Staff<br />In order to comply with local labour laws our chalet and Hotel staff have one day’s rest each week and will otherwise work on a rota basis. On their days off, our staff will leave out a simple continental breakfast and are then off work until the following day. During this time, no other catering is provided. In the evening you have the opportunity to sample dinner in one of the village restaurants. <br />Some chalets and Hotels have chalet and occasionally other resort staff living in, whilst in others there are no resident staff. If this is an important factor in choosing your chalet, please make this known to the person booking your holiday, although we cannot guarantee in any event resort staff may not be present in the property.<br />d) Cleaning and hygiene<br />Your bedroom will normally be clean and tidy for your arrival (subject to guests’ departure/arrival times) and en suite bathrooms will be cleaned once, mid-week, during your stay. Otherwise its state is left to you. The chalet or hotel staff will normally empty your accessible waste bins each day and clean all communal rooms (except on their day off). We are particularly conscious of the need for catering hygiene and during their pre-season training course, all our catering staff will have been trained to the City &amp; Guilds Level 2 in Food Safety. Our managers also carry out spot checks and full hygiene inspections regularly. If you are unhappy with any aspect of chalet hygiene or cleaning, please raise the matter immediately in resort so that appropriate action can be taken. Our reservations staff can give details of laundry facilities in resorts as our chalets and hotels do not have facilities for guests to use.<br />e) Slipper zones<br />We ask guests not to wear outdoor shoes or boots inside chalets and hotels for reasons of hygiene and to protect the furnishings and fittings, so please ensure that you take slippers or indoor shoes with you.<br />f) Security<br />Our properties do not have safes for securing guests’ valuables and it is unusual for chalets to be locked during the day or overnight, or for there to be locks on bedroom doors. Hotels however normally have a night porter on duty. In many cases we offer keys, key cards or combination locks for which a deposit may be payable, but this cannot be guaranteed. In some chalets, parts of the building may be shared by other residents using the same communal entrance. Although we do not specify these points in each chalet description, if it is of concern please ask our reservations staff for details. We cannot accept liability for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or ski equipment from any accommodation.<br />g) Telephones<br />Our properties do not have telephones. If a telephone facility is important to you we recommend you take a mobile phone. <br />h) TVs / DVDs<br />Some of the larger chalets have TVs and DVD-players which guests may use to play their own DVDs. Unfortunately, if TVs or DVD players become unserviceable, we cannot always get immediate replacements as the UK systems are not compatible with local versions and we may have to obtain spares from the UK. Where a TV is advertised, no guarantee is implied as to how many English-speaking channels will be available, if any, whilst some are advertised as “TV/DVD” which implies that no channels (satellite or otherwise) are available and that the TV is to be used for playing DVDs only.<br />i) Smoking<br />We operate a strict no-smoking policy in all our chalets and hotels, which includes the use of E-Cigarettes. A guest who breaches this policy will be liable to pay a fine of €100 / CHF150 to pay for additional deep-cleaning required, and will be held liable for all other consequential damages sought against Hotelplan Ltd by its other guests and/or the property owners.<br />j) Pets<br />Notwithstanding changes to UK legislation, we do not permit pets in our properties.<br />k) Child Care<br />Please note that it is not possible for us to child-proof our chalets and hotels, and that children, their behaviour and their safety, remain the sole responsibility of their parents at all times, including during adult dinners.<br />l) New-Build Projects &amp; Refurbishments<br />A number of chalets and hotels are newly built or substantially converted or refurbished for us each season, and we take every possible care with the owners to ensure that each such property is completed on schedule. Clearly however, matters outside our direct control, such as local authorities or adverse weather at critical times for example, can occasionally cause delays, and/or there may be changes to the designer’s or architect’s plans upon which we have based our description. In the event that either eventuality happens, we will advise you as soon as any impact on your holiday is clear in accordance with clause 4(a) of the Booking Conditions. <br />m) Leisure facilities<br />We do not normally provide separate towels for leisure facilities, so we suggest you bring your own towels for use of such leisure facilities. Leisure facilities may be subject to limited opening hours, i.e. 4pm-7pm and are normally out of use for at least one day per week while they are cleaned.<br />Swimming-pool, hot-tub, spa-bath and sauna temperatures are determined by the owners in accordance with local regulations or guidelines, and may not always match guests’ expectations. We do not recommend that children or those suffering with heart conditions use hot-tubs, saunas or steam rooms. Please note that there are no Lifeguards on duty and we cannot guarantee staff will be available in or around the pool or hot-tub area at all times. Please note that you use all such leisure facilities at your own risk, and are responsible in particular for your children’s safety in leisure facilities at all times.<br />Should any leisure facility become unavailable for any reason, we cannot guarantee being able to repair or replace it during your holiday, and do not offer compensation for inconvenience or curtailed use in such an event.<br />n) Check-in<br />Your room will normally be available from 4pm onwards but please bear with us if it takes a little longer. If you are leaving resort after 10am, we would ask that you please vacate your bedrooms before this time so that they can be made ready for arriving guests. <br />In common with standard hotel industry practice, we reserve the right to take credit card imprints upon check-in at our hotels and certain chalets to cover potential damage costs or breakages.<br />We reserve the right to apply a damage deposit of up to £1,000 per booking either in the UK prior to departure or on arrival in resort. This is payable either by debit or credit card. We appreciate that normal usage causes wear upon furniture, fixtures and fittings and this is always taken in to consideration, but actual damage caused by guests, either by accident or negligence, must be paid for by the person who caused it, or by the party leader of the group, or will be retained from the Damage Deposit (where taken).<br />o) Porterage<br />Porterage is not included in the cost of the holiday. If you allow our staff or coach drivers to assist with the transfer of your luggage from or to the main coach and/or feeder vehicles, you do so entirely at your own risk as we do not accept responsibility for your luggage at any time and you remain responsible at all times for ensuring your luggage is on the appropriate vehicle.<br />p) Season start-up<br />We work hard to train all our staff pre-season to the standard required to deliver the services outlined in our brochure and on our website, but our holiday prices are kept low for the first week of the season, reflecting the need for a degree of tolerance from our guests for the fact that staff are settling in to new roles.<br />q) Wi-Fi in our own-run chalets hotels<br />We have Wi-Fi installed and available in the public areas of all our chalets and hotels, but signal strength is likely to vary by property, depending on location. However, in the event that technical or other issues prevent this, no refund or compensation will be paid and there is no guarantee that Wi-Fi is typically available in bedrooms. We ask for your understanding and patience in remembering that the connections in the mountains are not as reliable or as strong as you may be used to in the UK. The connections will, in normal circumstances, be suitable for the checking of emails and basic web-browsing, but the downloading and streaming of films and other media will not be possible. We also request that you limit usage to one device per person, to avoid over-loading the system and thereby restricting its availability to other guests. Safe-keeping of your laptop computer/tablet/smartphone is your own responsibility, as is ensuring that it is properly insured for the circumstances above; no liability will be accepted for damage to or loss or theft of laptops from accommodation, including if your insurance company refuses to pay out for any reason. We also accept no liability for any loss of data or virus infection to your device whilst on holiday with us, however caused. In some mountain resorts, signal strength is limited throughout the resort not just in our properties.</p>
<p>r) Children’s High Tea:<br />Children’s High Tea in Chalets High tea, the main meal of the day for children under 11 years old, is usually at 5pm, however this can vary by property and details will be given on arrival. Dinner in our chalets is strictly for adults and teenagers only, and children under 11 years of age are not allowed at the dinner table unless a chalet has been booked exclusively by one group.<br />Children’s High Tea in Chalet Hotels: In our own-run hotels, children from 8 years can join adult dinner and have the adult meal.<br />In chalet properties and Chalet Hotels: Christmas dinner and sometimes meals on arrival nights are the only other exceptions. In our partner hotels, there are no age restrictions on meals.</p>
<p><strong>Ski Pack</strong><br />Most of our excursion and activity partners in resorts have been trusted Inghams partners for many years, and all have been vetted and approved by our senior overseas managers. When you book any excursion or activity advertised in our brochures / on our websites, you can therefore rely on the supplier’s credentials, service levels and professionalism, and of course on the services of your Inghams Representative or local agent to help with every detail of the arrangements for you. If however you, or your travel agent on your behalf, choose to book any excursion or activity directly with a third party supplier, please note that Inghams accept no liability whatsoever for any aspect of its operation. This includes a) that our Reps will not be able to provide our normal high levels of service to you in respect of such arrangements, or even basic details of pick-up times or locations, as these will not be provided to us by the companies concerned if the booking is not through ourselves, and b) that all applicable complaints, whether in resort or subsequently, and any claims for personal injury, refunds or compensation must be addressed to your chosen excursion/activity supplier directly, or to your travel agent as appropriate.<br />a) Ski Lessons<br />If you know that you will require lessons, we advise you to pre-book regardless of the date of your holiday. Our grading system (for adults and children) is to help you and our resorts ensure that the correct classes are pre-booked prior to your arrival. Please ensure that you discuss your needs with our reservations or resort teams prior to booking, to ensure that the appropriate level is booked in advance as ski schools cannot always guarantee that movements between classes may be effected. <br />Throughout the season, and in particular during the continental school holidays (our reservations staff have the dates), the length, timing and availability of the ski school lessons can change with little warning. Ski schools are also extremely busy and it is imperative that you book in advance to avoid disappointment. Occasionally resorts ask that a minimum number of guests book into a lesson in order for it to go ahead. In the unlikely event your lesson is cancelled due to low numbers, alternative arrangements will be offered if possible, usually to the same monetary value as the lessons originally booked, particularly if private or small group lessons are offered as an alternative, as these are often deemed far more beneficial. You will be responsible for any additional costs incurred over and above this. The ski school price quoted is that of the ski school’s standard group lessons. Private lessons can also be booked in advance, please discuss your requirements with our reservations team. <br />b) Equipment Hire<br />The equipment is priced according to the grade of ski you choose. If you require a ski boot larger than size 12, please advise us at the time of booking so that we can inform the resort in advance. We strongly recommend that you check that your personal insurance covers you for loss/damage to hired equipment. Ski-hire shops may offer insurance to you and we recommend that you accept this if your own travel insurance policy does not cover you.<br />c) Lift Passes<br />A passport size photo may be required for lift passes. Beginners do not always require a lift pass for the first days of skiing (see the ski pack panel for your chosen resort). Some resorts will only offer the electronic lift pass and may ask you to pay a deposit in resort (generally refundable at the end of your holiday). Some resorts may offer discounted rates for senior persons and walkers intending not to ski. If not detailed in the ski pack panel for your chosen resort, please ask at the point of booking or with our staff in resort. At the beginning and end of season, or at any other time due to snow or other weather conditions, resorts may limit the number of lifts in operation. Inghams accepts no liability in such situations; you may however have the potential to claim under your travel insurance if the provider has made no refund in resort. The lift pass provider will normally only consider a refund where the lift pass has not been activated. We recommend that you make a note of your lift pass number (taking a photo is ideal), in case of loss.<br />d) Children’s Free Lift Passes/Equipment &amp; Family Lift Passes<br />Each resort has different criteria for the ages of children eligible for free or reduced prices. In many resorts, children’s free passes will require the purchase of the same type and duration lift pass as purchased by the parents. In some resorts, Family Lift Passes are available but with certain stipulations relating to the composition of the family grouping. Please ask our reservations or resort staff when booking. <br />e) Snow<br />Whilst we obviously cannot guarantee snow, all our resorts are chosen for their reliable snow records. Many of our resorts also have the advantage of glaciers, which ensure snow almost all year round. Snow conditions can change dramatically overnight, and will not be accepted as a valid reason for you to cancel your ski or Lapland holiday. If there is such poor snow that the lift company and ski-school in your booked resort decide that you are unable to ski, we will endeavour to transport you daily to another ski area, where appropriate.<br />f) Flight Delays<br />If your flight is delayed and you “lose” a day’s equipment or lift pass, we regret that we are not able to make any refund in respect of pre-booked equipment or lift passes. A pro-rata refund should be claimed from your travel insurance.</p>
<p><strong>LOCAL EXCURSIONS/LOCAL SKI PACKS/LOCAL ACTIVITIES</strong> <br />For any excursion, ski pack, or activity booked whilst you are on holiday, your contract will be with the provider of the excursion, ski pack, or activity and not with Hotelplan Ltd.<br />Where you have booked an excursion, ski pack, or activity we act as agent only for the provider of the service. We are not responsible for the provision of the excursion, ski pack or activity or for anything that happens during the course of its provision by the provider. Please note this also includes all sporting activities and excursions.<br />For the use of most motorised vehicles, for example snowmobiles and skidoos, most travel insurance policies will offer cover for personal injury and medical expenses but will not cover damage to the vehicle itself. Therefore, the provider may take and retain for the duration of the activity an insurance deposit or excess, often in the region of €800.<br />Activities in Lapland: The activities described will not necessarily take place in the exact order in which they are described on the website/in the brochure and, due to circumstances outside our control, it may be necessary to vary the itineraries at very short notice. Hotelplan Ltd reserves the right to do this when necessary. The length of the rides shown in our itineraries is a guideline only, and may vary according to safety or weather conditions, the number of huskies and reindeer available, and other issues beyond our control and no guarantee is given as to the specific length of each ride.<br />‘Huskies’ is the generic term for the range of breeds used by Lapland’s dog-sled providers. Some features included in the itineraries rely on satisfactory levels of snow and ice and, should the levels be inappropriate, suppliers will do their best to offer alternative activities. Insufficient snow or ice is not considered a reason to cancel or grounds for compensation. Safety instructions are given prior to each activity or safari, not including tobogganing and other similar informal activities, and parents are reminded that children must remain under their care and control at all times. There is a minimum age of 18 years to drive a husky sled, and there is usually a minimum size and weight requirement, for safety reasons.<br />During snowmobile excursions, children are transported in a separate sled driven by the guide, whilst parents drive or are a passenger on a separate snowmobile. Young children cannot ride pillion on a snowmobile and the recommended minimum height to ride pillion is usually 1.40m.<br />As most activities take place outdoors in Arctic conditions, they are not all suitable for babies and very young children. We take advice from our suppliers daily on whether children under 4 years old should be allowed to participate in certain activities due to weather conditions and other factors. No refund or compensation is applicable if young children and the accompanying carer are unable to take part in a particular activity. If any activity, whether pre-booked in the UK or booked locally, does not ultimately take place, the liability of Hotelplan Ltd is limited to a refund of the price paid for that specific activity only, and no additional compensation will be payable.<br />Whilst it is hoped that the Northern Lights will appear for our guests, this natural phenomena can never be guaranteed and no refund or compensation is applicable should they not be visible.<br />We endeavour to ensure that all activities booked through us are undertaken with reasonable skill and care in accordance with local laws, regulations and customs. However, it is not feasible to make the activity programmes completely risk free and it is a condition of your booking that you accept that you are taking risks and that it is your responsibility to be insured to the levels reasonably required for your circumstances.</p>
<p>Lapland Climate: In December, temperatures in Lapland normally range between -7˚c and -35˚c, with daylight usually limited to between 10:30 and 14:00 and long periods of twilight either side of night.<br />Whilst thermal suits and boots are provided for our Lapland guests (see specific holiday details), you are advised to bring layers of thermal and fleeced clothing to wear underneath when you are outdoors. Several layers of clothing provide better insulation from the cold than one or two thick items. Balaclavas, face masks and extra warm headgear are also suggested. The heating in hotels is usually extremely efficient, so lighter clothing is required indoors.</p>
<p>High Altitude Resorts: You should be aware that some people experience difficulties in high altitude resorts and it may be advisable to seek advice from your doctor before travel if you have any medical conditions which this may exacerbate.</p>
<p>Driving abroad: From 8 June 2015, the paper counterpart to the photo card driving licence will not be valid and will no longer be issued by the DVLA. The counterpart was introduced to display driving licence details that could not be included on the photo card. These details include some vehicle categories you are entitled to drive and any endorsement/penalty points. For more information go to <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/news/driving-licence-changes" target="_blank" title="driving license changes">www.gov.uk/government/news/driving-licence-changes</a><br />We recommend that you check the Government website for the most up-to-date information: <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit" target="_blank" title="EU after Brexit">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit</a></p>
<p><br /><strong>SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS</strong><br />For your own safety and that of other mountain users, please refer to the Mountain Safety information included in your Information Pack provided on your arrival in resort.</p>]]></bodyText>
