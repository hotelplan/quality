<h2 id="FAQs">Privacy FAQs</h2>
<p>If you have any specific questions about privacy, you may find the answer in our Frequently Asked Questions.</p>
<h3>What is privacy all about?</h3>
<p>Privacy is the discipline of handling personal information in a strictly controlled manner, to meet the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be transparent about any personal information that is collected and what it will be used for;</li>
<li>to protect the information from accidental or malicious loss, damage, unlawful processing or disclosure;</li>
<li>for legal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why should I care about privacy?</h3>
<p>Your personal information is extremely important and there are a number of threats associated with the inappropriate disclosure and/or use of your information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>identity theft</li>
<li>fraud</li>
<li>SPAM</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the UK Fraud Prevention Service (CIFAS), nearly two thirds of all fraud is the direct result of account takeovers, impersonation and the misuse of personal details. To reduce the risks, you must treat your personal information with great care and only disclose it if you feel confident that it will be handled appropriately.</p>
<h3>Is my personal information safe with Inghams?</h3>
<p>While the safety of your personal information can never be 100% guaranteed, we take privacy extremely seriously and adopt many measures to minimise the risks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>we use industry standard technologies to protect our IT systems from accidental or intentional (malicious) mis-use;</li>
<li>we provide privacy training to our staff, to ensure that they understand their responsibilities when handling your personal information, and the correct processes to follow;</li>
<li>we perform risk assessments and privacy impact assessments when starting a new project and when hiring a 3rd party to process personal information on our</li>
</ul>
<h3>What can I do to protect my personal information?</h3>
<p>Don't automatically trust every website or email which asks you to provide your personal information. Take time to check that the request is valid, and that the personal information requested is absolutely necessary for the services that you are looking to use.</p>
<h3>Why has Inghams created a privacy centre?</h3>
<p>This privacy centre aims to provide one place to find all the information you need about how we handle your personal information. There are a few key objectives:</p>
<ul>
