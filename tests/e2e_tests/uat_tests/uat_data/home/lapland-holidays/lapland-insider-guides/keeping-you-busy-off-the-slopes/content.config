<h2>Cross country skiing</h2>
<p><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/media/13088357/man-cross-country-skiing.jpg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="off slope activities" data-udi="umb://media/5434ca2f425e479fbfbaaa87023acae4" /></p>
<p><span>Why not join the family for an enjoyable day out cross-country skiing? The scenery is wonderful and you'll keep fit at the same time. It's a gentler way to take in the fresh pine scents and the sheer tranquility and beauty of winter in the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span>Skiers often find that cross-country skiing is one of the best ways to fully take in their surroundings. With cross-country skiing, you can go at your own pace and take advantage of the silence that comes with being alone in the snow! </span></p>
<p><span>Get ready to see a different side of your favourite ski resort—one that's less about getting down the mountain as fast as possible, and more about enjoying the scenery while you're getting there.</span></p>
