<h3><img src="/media/13101086/sarriselka-resort.jpg" alt="saariselkaskiresort" data-udi="umb://media/18d76902dce24073aa10cf22ecf7376a" /></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Skiing in Saariselka</h2>
<p>Europe’s most northern ski resort, deep in the Arctic Circle, Saariselka is a true escape with Lapland’s highest records of average annual snowfall, almost 65cm. <br />It is the smallest of the 3 resorts but offers skiing and snowboarding in the most remote location - an unforgettable adventure.</p>
<p>Here, for intermediate and advanced skiers it’s not so much about space but about nature. Saariselka allows you to feel like you are skiing off-grid. The cleverly designed black run here takes you through the trees with the chance to go off-piste. <br />There are 2 freestyle parks and 1 snow park for the boarders and cross-country is hugely popular due to the vast terrain available.</p>
<p>If you are new to the slopes and want a small, quiet place - Saariselka's 5 blue runs will work perfectly. </p>
<p>The resort is uncommercialised and links back to the idea of being remote, but there are still plenty of accommodation options from glass cabins to hotel suites. It’s about reconnecting with nature in Saarislka and appreciating the unbelievable surroundings when staying here.</p>
<p><strong>The best resort in Lapland if you are</strong> - Snowboarders</p>
<p><strong>Best Saariselka ski run </strong>- the very famous Aurora Tobogganing run, the most northern toboggan run and Finland's longest. </p>
<p><strong>Inghams best top tip -</strong> It may be a true wilderness resort, but the Finnish still believe in the apres ski culture. When at the top of the mountain, it is well worth stopping off at the bar. With panoramic views of the area, good food and drink on offer and the chance to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights - make time to stop here.</p>
