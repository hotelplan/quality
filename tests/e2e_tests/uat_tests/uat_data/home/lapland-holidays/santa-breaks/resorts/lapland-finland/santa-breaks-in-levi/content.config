Whether you're seeking outdoor thrills, a chance to see the Northern Lights, or a taste of authentic Lappish culture, Levi is a place where magic comes to life in the midst of a winter wonderland. </span></p>
<h2>Winter wonderland</h2>
<p><span>Located North of the Arctic Circle, the landscape is dominated by snow-covered forests, frozen lakes, and glistening fells, creating a winter wonderland during the colder months. In recent years its infrastructure has been developed to an enviably high standard with an impressive range of accommodation and a wide choice of excellent restaurants and cosy bars. Whilst you are away, you may be lucky enough to </span>encounter the mystical Northern Lights, a celestial display of dancing colours that paint the night sky with hues of emerald green, sapphire blue, and fiery red, it really is the greatest light show on earth. </p>
<h2>The Santa Experience</h2>
<p><span>All of our three and four night Santa Breaks include a visit to Santa's Elves Hideaway at Tonttula, which is a short drive from resort. </span><span>Santa's Elves Hideaway is tucked away in a whimsical, snow-covered forest, adorned with twinkling candlelight. It's a magical place where the whole family can immerse themselves in an enchanting atmosphere. </span>Join the fun at one of Santa's magical workshops and make delicious gingerbread with Santa's friendly elves, meet Santa's reindeer and even attend Elf school, where you'll learn the secrets of Santa's Elves. There will also be plenty of exciting snow games for you to enjoy including tobogganing. The highlight of the day is meeting Santa in his cosy grotto - each family will have a private meeting with Santa in his grotto, and the children will receive a present during the visit.</p>
<h2>Arctic Activities </h2>
<p>There is always time to join your choice of additional optional activities, we have a range of excursions available to pre-book which allow you to immerse yourselves into the unique Lappish culture and traditions of the region. Whizz through the snowy fells on a <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/lapland-holidays/lapland-excursions">snowmobile safari</a>, s<span>peed through the wilderness and weave through the forest on a <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/lapland-holidays/lapland-excursions">husky excursion</a> or </span>glide through the snow on a <a data-udi="umb://document/f3f7299be0394217a8b2ec9b986fcc39" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f3f7299be0394217a8b2ec9b986fcc39}" title="Excursions Section">reindeer sleigh ride</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4 nights</strong> Wednesday to Sunday.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 1</strong></p>
<p>Your Inghams Santa Breaks Reps will be waiting at Kittilä airport to warmly welcome you to Lapland and bring you by coach to your accommodation. Shortly after arriving in Levi, you will collect your complimentary thermal suits and boots, which you will keep for the duration of your stay. There will be plenty of time to explore your snowy surroundings, build snowmen, find a toboggan and throw those mandatory snowballs. Join us for a welcome get-together to help you plan your activities for the next few days - see below for options. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #69182f;">DAY 2</strong></p>
<p>Today is the day! The time has come to meet the big man himself. A magical jaunt is in store with a visit to Santa's Elves Hideaway. Here each family will enjoy an exclusive private meeting with Santa - make sure you’ve written your letters! You can also take part in supervised festive games, cook sausages on an open fire, help the elves bake gingerbread biscuits and try making your own decorations in Elf School. Outdoors you can meet Comet the Reindeer or have great fun tobogganing in the snow. All children will receive a small gift - souvenirs that can be treasured for years.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 3</strong></p>
<p>Make the most of your stay by booking our exciting and excellent value optional excursions. Perhaps a combined husky and reindeer farm visit with sleigh rides in the morning, followed by an exhilarating family-friendly snowmobile safari in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Alternatively, explore Levi centre and the local shops, collect souvenirs or relax and enjoy a sauna at your accommodation in true Finnish style!</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>On Your Final Night</strong></p>
<p>Get ready for a Festive Feast! An evening of party games and a disco. Tuck into a buffet of traditional roast turkey Christmas dinner plus Lappish specialities. </p>
<p><em>Please note that the Festive Feast takes place on Day 4 for guests staying 4 nights.</em></p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 4</strong> (for 4 night guests only)</p>
<p>Levi is also Finland’s most famous ski resort, hosting World Cup ski events on its uncrowded snow-sure pistes, and guests on the 4-night Santa Break can pre-book our exclusive Inghams 'Ski Taster' package to give the sport a go on Levi's beginner-friendly South slopes. Perhaps you would prefer to wander around the local craft shops, relax at the hotel swimming pool or simply play in the snow. Then get ready for your Festive Feast in the evening <em>(see Day 3 for details).</em> After dinner, perhaps the Northern Lights will appear for that perfect end to your holiday.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 5</strong> (<strong>or DAY 4</strong> for 3 night guests)</p>
<p>After a magical few days, it’s time to say goodbye to your new friends before being transferred by coach to the airport for your flight home.</p>
<p><em>Please note the above itinerary may vary according to arrival and departure times. Other activities such as horse-sleigh rides and visits to the SnowHotel (from mid-Dec) may also be available locally.</em></p>]]></yourItinerary>
