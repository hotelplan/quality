  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>San Gimignano</strong> is one of the most characteristic towns of the Tuscan landscape. Its historical centre has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. It is surrounded by medieval walls and has an extraordinary number of well-preserved Romanesque and Gothic buildings. The town produces its renowned white wine Vernaccia di San Gimignano on the surrounding hills. San Gimignano offers a unique panorama thanks to its tall medieval towers, all preserved to the present day in good conditions. San Gimignano is an exceptional case, since ancient towers in other locations have often been torn down for various reasons during the centuries. In this town you can also see the Palazzo Comunale and wander around two beautiful piazzas: Piazza della Cisterna and Piazza del Duomo. The first one is triangular and surrounded by ancient palazzi, the second one probably hosted the local cathedral in past.</p>
<p><strong> Monteriggioni</strong> is a medieval town still surrounded by its ancient walls, which follow the shape of the hill. The walls have two gates, once facing north and one facing south, which were build to provide access to Florence and Rome respectively. Surrounded by green hills this walled little town strikes the eye from the distance. It is a must-see if you are touring the Chianti area.</p>
<p><strong>Montalcino</strong> sits on the top of a hill. This medieval town has a gorgeous fortress and is surrounded by walls. However, it is the Brunello di Montalcino, the superb wine produced here that makes this place famous. There are walking and cycling paths departing from Montalcino and you can follow them to discover the valley, reach Siena or explore nearby villages. Other pretty towns to visit are Radda and Gaiole in Chianti, Colle Val d’Elsa and Montalcino.</p>]]></bodyText>
