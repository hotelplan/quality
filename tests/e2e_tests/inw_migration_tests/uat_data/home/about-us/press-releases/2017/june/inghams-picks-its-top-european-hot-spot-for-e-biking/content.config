<p>This week marks Bike Week 2017*, an annual recognition of cycling which encourages ‘everyday cycling for everyone’. In celebration of this, specialist tour operator Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains is recommending its top summer region to try e-biking.</p>
<p>Inghams has recently seen a proliferation in the use of e-bikes (electric-assisted bikes) to explore a local destination. Gone are the days where biking in the mountains was reserved only for the ultra-fit experts: e-biking encourages people of all cycling abilities and fitness levels to access and enjoy the mountains on two wheels.</p>
<p>Many Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains resorts in Switzerland, Italy, and France thus cater to this rising trend. However, a top destination for e-biking is the Kitzbüheler Alps and Wilder Kaiser Mountains in Austria’s Tyrol, the world’s biggest e-biking region!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Westendorf, Söll, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kitzbühel </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and St. Johann form </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">part of the biggest e-biking region in the world<br /></span>Home to the Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains resorts of Westendorf, Söll, Ellmau, Kitzbühel and St. Johann, Austria’s Kitzbüheler Alps and Wilder Kaiser Mountains invite visitors to discover the joy of e-biking in the mountains, with a staggering 1,000km of well-maintained, scenic trails. E-bikes are available to rent from over 40 hire stations (which include specialist sports shops and hotels) and approximately 80 battery replacement / charging stations (in the form of hotels, mountain alms and top beauty spots) are sprinkled across the region. All are highlighted on the Kitzbüheler Alps and Wilder Kaiser Mountains e-bike map, available from local tourist information offices from as little as €1.00. For more information, guests can speak to their in-resort Inghams Representative.</p>
<p>In addition to these exceptional services, the e-biking routes which carve through the region offer guests unforgettable journeys to breathtaking scenic hotspots, allowing them to discover the network’s most beautiful hidden corners. These are graded according to difficulty and range from high altitude climbs, which can be effortlessly mastered thanks to the e-bikes’ electric motors (the batteries in which last for approximately 60km), to relaxing routes along streams or through forested valleys. It’s no wonder the region is a paradise for e-biking enthusiasts!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guided e-bike tours with Inghams<br /></span>The charming, traditional market towns of Kitzbühel and St. Johann are set in a broad valley basin between the Kitzbüheler Alps and the Wilder Kaiser Mountains and boast miles of fantastic e-biking routes to explore. In Kitzbühel, Inghams offers guided e-bike tours up to four times per week from €39.00 (approximately £34) per person per tour. The tours last three hours and include e-bike hire, a map and are led by an expert guide. From St. Johann, guests can join the Kitzbühel tours by hopping on a short train journey, free with the St. Johann Guest Card, which is available to all on arrival to resort. Tours can be booked locally with the Inghams Representative.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a seven night holiday on a half board basis at the four-star Sporthotel Austria in St. Johann, Austria, from £759 per person in August. To book, visit www.inghams.co.uk/lakes-mountains-holidays or call 01483 791 116.</p>
