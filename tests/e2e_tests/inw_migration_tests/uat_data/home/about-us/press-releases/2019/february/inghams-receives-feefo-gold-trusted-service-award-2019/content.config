<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>INGHAMS RECEIVES FEEFO GOLD TRUSTED SERVICE AWARD 2019</u></strong></p>
<p>Specialist tour operator <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk">Inghams</a> is now the proud winner of a Feefo Gold Trusted Service award, an independent seal of excellence that recognises businesses for delivering exceptional experiences, as rated by real customers.</p>
<p>Created by Feefo, Trusted Service is awarded to those businesses that use Feefo to collect genuine reviews and insights. Inghams met Feefo’s criteria of excellence by collecting at least 50 reviews between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2018 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2018, with a Feefo service rating of between 4.5 and 5.0 out of 5.0. This accreditation is unique in that it is based purely on the interactions of real customers. As all reviews are verified as genuine, the accreditation is a true reflection of a business’ commitment to outstanding service.</p>
<p>Ed Deason, Head of Guest Relations &amp; Guest Experience at Inghams, commented: “We’re thrilled to have achieved this award, which recognises the hard work of all our staff – both in the UK and overseas – to give customers exceptional holiday experiences. This year, Inghams celebrates its 85<sup>th</sup> year in operation and we remain committed to delivering the highest quality of service for our customers. We value all customer feedback, as it is vitally important to help us constantly improve, but this recognition is an honour and we thank those who kindly took the time to review us on Feefo. The Gold Trusted Service award is a symbol of trust and it really shows our customers that they can book with Inghams in confidence. We’re looking forward to another successful year ahead!”</p>
