<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>NEW YEAR NEW YOU: Try Something New In 2018<br />Ideas And Inspiration From Inghams</u></strong></p>
<p>Inghams Lakes &amp; Mountains is giving guests the opportunity to try something NEW this year, as part of its expanded Summer 2018 programme, which now includes new programmes in Italy and Austria, and a range of new multi-centre holidays in Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by Inghams last year found that nearly two thirds (over 59%) of travellers try something new on holiday. On Inghams’ new programmes, guests will have the opportunity to go glacier hiking in Chamonix, e-biking in Kitzbühel, or perhaps discovering a new hobby!</p>
<p><strong><u>Chill Out In Chamonix On The Mer De Glace</u>       <u><br /></u></strong>In the heat of summer, why not cool off in the newly renovated Refuge du Montenvers and spend an unforgettable night on the Mer de Glace, Chamonix’s famous glacier? Perched up high at 2,050m, Refuge du Montenvers is a place of history: built in 1880 to accommodate the first mountaineers and travellers, the building has been witness to some of the world’s greatest mountain climbers and adventurers, famous artists and writers, and it offers a journey into the past. Watch the sun go down, followed by a three-course dinner and some star gazing. The next morning, after a hearty breakfast, take advantage of being up before the crowds and venture to the ice caves or explore the various walking trails whilst soaking up the staggering scenery. Inghams’ Overnight Glacier Experience<em>,</em> which is new for Summer 2018, can be pre-booked from £105 per person and includes an evening meal and breakfast.   </p>
<p>Alternatively, guests can enjoy an exhilarating guided glacier hike as part of Inghams’ Ice, Air &amp; Rapids excursion. The two-and-a-half day adventure invites those seeking a non-stop mountain holiday experience to challenge themselves and relish big thrills, with tandem paragliding and white water rafting also included. The excursion can be pre-booked from £260 per person and includes all equipment. Guests must be aged 12 and over to partake.</p>

<p><strong><u>Glide Through The Kitzbüheler Alps On An E-Bike</u>           <u><br /></u></strong>Gone are the days when biking in the mountains was reserved only for the ultra-fit experts: e-biking encourages people of all cycling abilities and fitness levels to access and enjoy the mountains on two wheels. The resort of Kitzbühel forms part of the world’s biggest e-biking region! One thousand kilometres of fantastic trails carve through the terrain, offering guests unforgettable journeys to breathtaking scenic hotspots and to some of the network’s most beautiful hidden corners. The routes are graded according to difficulty and range from high altitude climbs, which can be effortlessly mastered thanks to the e-bikes’ electric motors (the batteries in which last for approximately 60km), to relaxing routes alongside streams or through forested valleys.  </p>
<p>New for Summer 2018, Inghams is offering a bespoke guided e-biking programme for all guests staying in Chalet Linda. The programme includes five guided rides per week, each varying in levels of difficulty and lasting approximately three hours. Following the tour, guests will have the option to keep the e-bike for the rest of the day, to continue exploring the area on their own. The guided e-bike rides start from €39 (approximately £34) per person per ride and can be booked in resort via the Inghams Representative (subject to minimum numbers).</p>
