  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>Inghams, the expert <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays">ski holiday operator</a> renowned for taking skiers and snowboarders to exciting mountain destinations across Europe and Canada have this week announced an offer on their short week January ski breaks—despite ski holiday booking numbers for the 2021/22 winter ski season remaining high.</strong></p>
<p>The package ski holiday provider, recently listed by Which? as one of the travel companies with the ‘best flexible policies’ post-covid—made the decision to offer £100 per person off their 4 or 5-night ski breaks departing on the 3rd or 4th of January 2022 for a limited time only, to allow their customers the chance to squeeze an extra ski holiday in next winter.</p>
<p><strong>Inghams CEO, Joe Ponte said;</strong></p>
<p>“Ski industry data has shown that customers are thinking about ways they can make up for lost time on the slopes next winter, either by booking longer or multiple ski trips for the 2021/22 ski season.</p>
<p>The opportunity to add a short ski break away in early January for less, is a great value opportunity for Inghams customers to spend more time on the slopes in 2022.”</p>
<p>Due to Christmas day falling on a Saturday this year, changes to flight schedules have allowed the experienced ski holiday provider to package up this unique short break. So, skiers and snowboarders can start 2022 as they mean to go on with this limited time offer, when staying in their pick of hotels, chalets and self-catered apartments in Austria* and France* and selected resorts in Switzerland and Italy. With flights available from Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, London Gatwick and London Stanstead.</p>
