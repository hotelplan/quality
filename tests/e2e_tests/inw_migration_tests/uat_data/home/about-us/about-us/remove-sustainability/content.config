<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>At Inghams, we’re passionate about travel, and it’s our passion that drives us to make a difference in the world. As we continue to offer activity-based holidays in the great outdoors, in some of nature’s most magnificent locations across Europe and Canada, we know it is essential that we contribute to industry wide change for a more sustainable future.</span></span></p>

<h2>Committed to Change</h2>

<p><span>We are proud to announce that Hotelplan was a signatory and launch partner of the</span><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>Glasgow Declaration</span></a><span> on Climate Action in Tourism, launched at the COP26 climate change conference in November 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>We, along with all our sister brands within the Hotelplan Group, are committed to change. The declaration aims to raise the climate protection ambitions of all tourism businesses, taking strong action to support the global commitment to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero as soon as possible before 2050.</span></p>
<p><span>We stand alongside a group of like-minded travel and tourism companies acknowledging the environment around us, the impact we have had and now our duty to protect and rebuild what is left. We will learn from one another, take responsibility for our actions (at an individual level, company level and industry level) and push for regulatory action, research and development.</span></p>
<p><span>There is no excuse for waiting, this is why we are acting now. Our first step is publishing our climate action plan which directly addresses our impact and what we are doing to reduce it.</span></p>

<h2>Our Climate Action Plan</h2>
<p><span>Our climate action plan has four elements. We measure our impact, we reduce our carbon footprint, we want to mitigate any negative impact we do have and we communicate about our progress.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Measure</strong></h2>
<p>A crucial part of any climate action plan, we wanted to ensure we have an an accurate starting point so we can measure progress over time, working towards the level of reduction and removal that the science tells us is critical.</p>
<p>We have been working with ecollective to measure the carbon emissions of every one of our holidays - including all transport, accommodation, activities and excursions - as well as operational activities involved in running the Hotelplan UK business. We’re excited to be able to publish our Climate Paper and Biodiversity Paper that outlines our clear planet goals for 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>With clear calculations in place, we can confidently set about tackling the next challenge…reducing our footprint and removing our carbon.</p>

<h2><strong>Reduce</strong></h2>
<p>Now our carbon audit is complete and we have released our Climate Paper and Biodiversity Papers, as part of this audit, we have created a new partnership with Klimate to help us in achieving the removal of our carbon from the atmosphere. You can find out more about this partnership and Kliamte.co <a data-udi="umb://document/791fa5aa176246cbbaa02331f3c763ef" href="/%7blocalLink:umb:/document/791fa5aa176246cbbaa02331f3c763ef%7d" title="Partnerships" data-anchor="#">here</a>.</p>
<p>We must adapt our operations and reduce our footprint, both on the climate and the natural world, and we must do this with our suppliers, our partners and of course our customers all on board. </p>
<p>What makes our trips truly memorable for customers will not change, and we are confident they will ultimately be better. Our aim is that all our efforts will help ensure that our holidays will still going for another 85 years. </p>

<h2><strong>Mitigate</strong></h2>
<p><span></span><span></span><span>Alongside our promise to measure, remove and reduce our carbon footprint in the coming years, is our promise to protect and restore nature as part of our partnership with Rewilding Britain, a journey we excited to see flourish.</span></p>
<p>The concept of rewilding is fundamental to the long term resilience of our holidays, as well as underpinning all our health and wellbeing. We will be talking more about our exciting new plans as soon our plans are confirmed, but in the meantime you can read more about our plans with Rewilding Britain with our Biodiversity Paper.</p>

<h2><strong>Communicate</strong></h2>
<p><span>The final part of our action plan is all about communication and collaboration. It is our promise to talk openly and honestly about our progress, admitting when we fall short of our ambition and celebrating all the successes we know we will have along the way. </span><span>It is about bringing everyone with us on this journey; our customers, our staff and our partners.</span></p>
