<p>Venture off the well-known tourist trails and enjoy an authentic, first-hand experience of the way of life in the Italian countryside. Experience the laid-back atmosphere by staying in one of our traditional rural retreats.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Italians have restored many of their abandoned rural properties, turning them into attractive Masseria and Agriturismo properties. They make for wonderful places to stay, being full of character and historic features.</p>
<p>A slower pace of life, rolling countryside views and hearty Italian dinners are a few of the things you can expect when you stay in one of our countryside retreats. Choose from a family-run agriturismo in the heart of <a data-udi="umb://document/58d85ec0faa548b2ab580143fdc9b722" href="/{localLink:umb://document/58d85ec0faa548b2ab580143fdc9b722}" title="Tuscany &amp; Umbria">Tuscany</a> or amongst the olive groves in <a data-udi="umb://document/d0c28188245b40a396dd64fb346dffcd" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d0c28188245b40a396dd64fb346dffcd}" title="Puglia">Puglia</a>, or indulge in a luxurious countryside spa hotel to really feel like you’re getting away from it all.</p>
<h3>What is an Agriturismo?</h3>
<p>An agriturismo provides an authentic farm stay in the Italian countryside. Some are working farms, making for a perfect attraction on a family holiday. Others are lovely, romantic dwellings - great for a couples' break.</p>
<h3>What is a Massaria?</h3>
<p>A masseria is a traditional farmhouse or country house on an estate, usually surrounded by rolling fields, groves and pastures. Many were fortified centuries ago against invasions by pirates or Turks. They provide delightful, characterful places to stay and are often working farms or vineyards. The accommodation ranges from rustic to luxurious, with swimming pools and pleasant gardens. Where possible, delicious meals are prepared using fresh produce from the farm. Guests may also be offered the chance to experience farm activities, like milking the cows or picking fruit. There is plenty of choice of accommodation, from a peaceful but simple rustic retreat in the beautiful countryside, to a prestige hotel with a spa and gourmet restaurant.</p>
