For winter 2024, there will be the brand new 3S cable car that'll travel from 1650 metres to the mountains summit at 3200 metres. It'll be replacing the current Jandri Express. Previously it had taken around 40 minutes to get to the top, but this new high speed gondola takes you to new heights in just 17 minutes!</span></span></p>]]></answer>
