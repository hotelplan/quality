  <answer><![CDATA[<p>From November 2024 we expect to see the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) – an automated IT system for registering non-EU nationals travelling for a short stay (up to 90 days within any 180 day period) each time they cross the external borders of European countries. It is anticipated that this will replace passport stamping and automate border control procedures. For more information on EES, please visit: <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees/general-information_en">General information - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>
<p>From 2025 onwards the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will be effective, which will require visa-exempt EU nationals, including UK citizens, to hold an electronic authorisation to travel to or within the Schengen Zone (currently 27 EU member states, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus). An ETIAS travel authorisation is a visa waiver which will be required regardless of the length of your visit. Once granted, it will be valid for 3 years or until your passport expires. It can only be applied for online and a fee will be payable unless an exemption applies. If you are unable to travel on your holiday because you have not obtained an ETIAS travel authorisation, our normal cancellation charges will apply. For more information on ETIAS, please visit: <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias/what-etias_en">What is ETIAS - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>
<p><strong>Travel Disruption:</strong> When entering and exiting countries, it is your responsibilty to give yourself extra time to get through the immigration queues in the airports as there will be delays. We may have to organise our transfers slightly to help with this and ensure that you have extra time.</p>
<p>The UK government and ABTA have also put together some useful information about holidaying in the EU after the 31st January 2020. These resources can be found below:</p>
