  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Through our partnership with winners of the prestigious ‘British Travel Awards’ Airport Parking &amp; Hotels – APH we are able to offer up to 35% discount to all of our Inghams Santa Breaks customers at Gatwick, Manchester, Newcastle, East Midlands and Bristol. With our Lapland flights all departing early in the morning, to maximise your time visiting the Arctic, why not take advantage of some of the great ‘Airport Hotel and Parking’ packages and stay at an airport hotel the night before you fly. This takes the stress out of getting to the airport in the morning on time and finding the car park, and allows you to wake up fully refreshed ready to head to the North Pole and to meet the big man himself. If an overnight stay is not for you then the ‘Meet &amp; Greet’ Valet Parking is the perfect way of dropping your car off. ‘Meet &amp; Greet’ Valet Parking saves you time, hassle free and so convenient. Simply drive to the airport terminal, where an APH chauffeur meets you and takes your car to their nearby secure car-park. On your return, your car is then delivered back to you directly at the terminal, for you to drive straight off home!</p>
