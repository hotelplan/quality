  <answer><![CDATA[<p>This is rare but should this happen, it is usually the fault of the airport handling agents rather than the railway. You should go to the train station as soon as the damage is noticed to fill out a damage form, ensure the railway staff take photos of the damage and we recommend you do too. Please also check your travel insurance to see if you can make a claim.</p>]]></answer>
