  <answer><![CDATA[<p>A payment will be required at the end of the booking process. If you are booking a holiday more than 10 weeks prior to travel, you will only pay a deposit of £150 per person to confirm the booking while the full balance will be due 10 weeks before departure (plus any additional non-refundable elements that may be added during booking) If you are booking within 10 weeks of your holiday departure date, full payment is required at the time of booking.</p>]]></answer>
