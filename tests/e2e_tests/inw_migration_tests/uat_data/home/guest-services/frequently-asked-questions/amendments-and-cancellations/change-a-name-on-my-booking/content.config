  <answer><![CDATA[<p>We don’t charge an admin fee for these changes, but will pass on any admin and/or re-ticketing charges from airlines and other travel providers. Some airlines and specific flights/routes may not permit flight or name changes. Changing all names on the booking will be classed as cancellation and incur the relevant cancellation fees at that point in time.</p>
<p>Please be aware that changing a date of birth may affect the cost of the holiday or any extras that you may have pre-booked.</p>
<p>If your title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Mstr, Ms, Dr) is incorrect on the paperwork this will not affect your travel as titles do not appear on passports. If you wish for us to change your title, please call your Travel Agent or, if you have booked with us directly, call our Reservations team on 01486 791111.</p>]]></answer>
