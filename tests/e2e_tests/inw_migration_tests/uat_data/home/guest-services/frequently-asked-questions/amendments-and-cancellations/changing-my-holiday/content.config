  <answer><![CDATA[<p>You can make a change or move your holiday to a later date up to the point that your full balance is due with no admin fee from us. Please contact your Travel Agent or call our Reservations team on <strong>01486 791111</strong> if you booked with us directly. You will need to cover any extra cost if the new arrangements are more expensive, or if the suppliers charge a fee for the change which we need to pass on. Supplier charges may include admin fees charged to us, as well as any costs which need to be paid by us at the time of booking to secure elements of your holiday, such as scheduled or low-cost airline flight costs, committed excursions and accommodation fees. Full balances will be due 10 weeks before departure (this may be earlier for bookings made with a Travel Agent). After this point our usual booking terms and conditions apply.</p>]]></answer>
