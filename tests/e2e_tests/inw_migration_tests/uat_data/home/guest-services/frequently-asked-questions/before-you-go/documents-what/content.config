  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>You will receive two sets of documentation when you book with us. After you have made or updated a booking you will receive a Holiday Invoice. Your Invoice will be sent to you either by email (where an email address is provided) or by post. If you have booked through one of our Travel Agent Partners they will forward a copy of the Inghams invoice as well as their Invoice. In both cases (booking direct with us or through a Travel Agent) a copy of our booking conditions will be sent to you. We always ask that as soon as you receive your holiday invoice you check it to ensure all details are correct and as agreed.</span></p>]]></answer>
