  <answer><![CDATA[<p>It is a condition of booking with us that you and your party take our suitable Winter sports insurance from a reputable provider. Please note that a standard travel insurance policy, including many ‘free’ bank and credit card policies, will not cover many of the winter activities involved in your holiday such as skiing, husky, reindeer and snowmobile safaris and we ask you to please check with your insurance policy provider that you have adequate cover for any of these additional, optional activities you plan to participate in. Please also note that an exclusion regarding damage to the actual snowmobile applies and if the snowmobile is damaged, a compulsory excess of €500-€800 will be payable direct to the excursion provider.</p>]]></answer>
