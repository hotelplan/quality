  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Yes. All families who book one of our local excursions from Levi, Ylläs or Saariselkä will have a private meeting with Santa at his enchanting workshop, where children will also be able to deliver their letters to him personally. Families will be able to meet Santa again at the gala dinner on the last evening of your holiday, when every child will receive a small gift and a certificate. We endeavour to make the experience as magical as possible for every child and in order to make sure that all children have the same experience with Santa, every child will receive the same gift at the gala dinner. We are not able to allow any additional gifts to be given to children at the workshop or at the gala dinner.</p>]]></answer>
