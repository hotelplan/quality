Austria continues to offer thrill after thrill from the end of spring to the beginning of autumn.</p>
<p class="geolocation-title"><strong>Vienna Festival, Vienna</strong></p>

<p>As befitting a city bursting at the seams with historical and cultural monuments Vienna has a rich and exciting cultural calendar. And the Vienna Festival is its definitive highlight.</p>
<p>The Vienna festival runs for 5-6 weeks every summer. Combining theatre, music, the visual arts and film, there are diverse range of performances and exhibitions to keep you fascinated throughout your stay.</p>
<p><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong></p>

<p>The Almabtrieb is a grand Austrian tradition which heralds the end of summer when the cows must be returned from mountain pastures to the fields of the valley. Every September/October instead of lamenting the end of the season the farmer dresses the cattle in fantastic head dresses and parade the cows down the mountain.</p>
<p>The annual cow train is a popular event often accompanied with music, markets, local food and drink. Most mountain villages in Austria host their own Almabtrieb. At Inghams we’re particularly fond of the ones in <a href="/{localLink:cc866bb5-7214-40f9-988c-7c1dd78caff8}" title="Alpbach"><strong>Alpbach</strong></a> and <a href="/{localLink:06b8a9fa-c734-4022-bc44-9d833956c0f7}" title="Westendorf"><strong>Westerndorf</strong></a>.</p>

<p>A landmark event on the world’s Jazz calendar, the Montreux Jazz Festival runs for two weeks each summer on the beautiful shores of Lake Geneva.

In the past it has attracted artists such as Nina Simone, Miles Davies, Lenorad Cohen and David Bowie.</p>
<p>The festival has a range of venues, from intimate jazz cafes to music in the park, which emphasise comfortable surroundings and quality music. The event is also an excellent opportunity to hear emerging artists. With associated foundations supporting musicians, the festival has a long history of encouraging new talent.</p>

<p>A Locarno tradition since 1946, the Piazza Grande, in the heart of the city, is given over to a huge outdoor screen. With room for 8,000 spectators, audiences flock to this central square to view the latest international films.</p>
<p>While it may not have the glitz and the glamour of Cannes, stars such as Anthony Hopkins, Quentin Tarantino, Sir Christopher Lee, Harrison Ford, and Faye Dunaway have all been spotted strolling the streets of Locarno during the festivities.</p>
<p>Awards, such as the Golden Leopard, are handed to the best films seen at the festival and the audience even have an opportunity to vote for their favourite. With its balmy Mediterranean climate, Locarno is simply the best location for an open air film-screening!</p>

<p>Taking place in August and September, the Lucerne Music Festival is a collaboration of classical music by artists from across the globe. Bringing together world-class orchestras, legendary conductors and maestro soloists, some 110,000 visitors descend on the shores of Lucerne for this spectacular three-part festival.</p>
<p>This summer event forms a trilogy of festivals with sister event the Easter Festival (in spring) and the Piano Festival (in the autumn). Yet it is Summer Festival, with frequent performance from the Lucerne Festival Orchestra and the Lucerne Festival Academy that are by far the most popular.</p>
<p>The event has huge international prestige. We highly recommend taking the opportunity to visit this festival during your summer holiday to Switzerland.</p>
