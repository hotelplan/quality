<p> </p>
<h2>An Alpine Wanderlust Where Holiday Memories Blossom</h2>
<p><span>Visitors joined us at the RHS Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival,</span><span> to experience the beauty of our Working With Nature Garden.</span> It’s no secret that we love the outdoors - our holidays serve as your VIP ticket to Europe’s stunning landscapes and cultural treasures.</p>
<p><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/media/13098078/img_5840.jpg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="RHS Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival" data-udi="umb://media/9b2dbae3f76a4fb39641aef3567a39cb" /></p>
<p class="first-token" data-sourcepos="1:1-1:29">It was this very passion that had inspired The Inghams Working With Nature Garden, drawing inspiration from our <a data-udi="umb://document/96a3e4d143704d3e93793368e4fc0416" href="/{localLink:umb://document/96a3e4d143704d3e93793368e4fc0416}" title="Walking Holidays">walking holidays</a> exploring some of Europe's most beautiful Alpine valleys.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:8">Visitors to our stand met with our friendly Inghams staff, eager to share all about our garden and the walking holidays that had inspired it. And while there, visitors jumped at the chance to win an unforgettable holiday to Switzerland worth £2,500, in partnership with Swiss Tourism.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Planting</h2>
<p>The planting, inspired by the lower valleys of Europe's Alpine region, offered visitors a delightful mix of flowering perennials and grasses native to these woodlands. The result was a stunning fusion of colours and textures that allowed them to connect with the beauty of nature and the great outdoors.</p>
<p><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/media/13098088/img_5924-1-1.jpg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="The Inghams Working With Nature Garden" data-udi="umb://media/f5663c5a08664012a18589cdb332da19" /></p>
<p>The garden's design also featured natural stone and gravel tracks, creating a harmonious atmosphere. The tracks wound their way through the garden, leading to a serene seating area that offered the perfect opportunity to pause, unwind, and bask in the shade provided by the glade-inspired planting.</p>
<p>A bio-swale captured excess water run-off and helped the garden to cope with varying periods of wet and dry weather. This cleverly designed feature, dug below the garden surface, included a drainage pipe. It captured and redirected water runoff, allowing it to be filtered naturally through the soil. As a result, our garden required less watering and reduced the risk of flooding.</p>

<h2>A Glimpse into Our Garden</h2>
<p><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/media/13098199/img_5899-2-838x450.jpg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="Inghams working with nature garden" data-udi="umb://media/37042c8e914b4948a52f143f7e594582" /></p>
<p><strong>Carpinus Betulus (European Hornbeam):</strong> This adaptable hedging plant thrives in changing climate conditions, training its bronze leaves throughout the winter months.</p>
<p><strong>Salix (Willow):</strong> Planted strategically to create dappled shade, the tree is polarded to maintain a smaller size, and its branches can be pruned and utilised for weaving.</p>
<p><strong>Betula nigra ‘Heritage’ (River Birch):</strong> Planted to create dappled shade, this plant has a beautiful textured cinnamon coloured bark.</p>
<p><strong>Dryopteris affinis Cristata:</strong> A semi-evergreen fern that produces tall arching fronds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is native to western and southern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Achillea Terracotta (Yarrow Terracotta):</strong> This tall clump-forming plant has pretty deep yellow flowers and is native to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Astrantia major ‘star of billion’:</strong> Leaves with branches of small green and white flowers. Native to central, eastern and southern Europe and likes moist and well drained soil in sun or part shade.</p>
<p><strong>Dry River Beds &amp; Bio-Swales:</strong> These features serve the dual purpose of collecting water and creating temporary streams.</p>
<p><strong>Compacted Gravel Path:</strong> A semi–permeable path that allows water to drain through during light rain and directs excess water into bio-swales during heavy rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Willow Fence:</strong> Beautifully crafted to reveal the flowing movement of water and mountain views.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Bench:</strong> A comfortable seating area created using reclaimed oak sleepers and Purbeck limestone boulders.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Choosing The Greener Path</h2>
<p>We believe in working with nature, not against it. This is why we are determined to take the greener path and become more environmentally friendly. And this commitment is reflected within our garden design.</p>
<p><img style="width: 500; height: 500;" src="/media/13098086/img_5825-2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=268.49642004773267" alt="the inghams working with nature garden" data-udi="umb://media/29241d7fa74742a4823981d2f9afc215" /></p>
<p>To manage excess water and adapt to changing weather conditions, our innovative garden features a bio-swale. This feature helps manage water effectively while promoting a sustainable and resilient environment.</p>]]></bodyText>
