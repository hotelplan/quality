  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Garda is perfectly located for those who enjoy walking. Offering lake front promenades and nearby mountainous areas, there’s something here for everybody to enjoy. Here are 3 of our favourite Lake Garda walking routes, suitable for everyone.</p>
<h3>A Leisurely Lake walk</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13081529/bardolino_waterfront.jpg" alt="Lake Garda walks" data-udi="umb://media/c4a77357060c4c8b8e0c55e5693cdd27" /></p>
<p>The perfect walk to welcome you to Lake Garda and explore the nearby towns. The promenade from Garda leads south to Bardolino (3km) and to Lasize (8km). Don’t be put off by the distance, firstly it is flat and paved (which makes it 100% wheelchair friendly!) and secondly, there are plenty of bars and places to sit and sunbathe or simply take in the view along the way.</p>
<p>Top tips:</p>
<p>Do it in the morning and enjoy the peacefulness of the lake or in the evening to watch the sunset (the path does invariably get busy during the day as it is the main pedestrian thoroughfare for Garda and Bard)</p>
<p>Watch out for the prices some of the bars are a bit pricey, after all you are paying for the beautiful view.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Paddle to the “Most beautiful place in the entire world”</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13062943/lake_garda_big.jpg" alt="Lake garda walks" data-udi="umb://media/0086cf4e69f34f90b050b933a32e0a75" /></p>
<p>“Since Europe was the most beautiful place on earth, Italy was the most beautiful country in Europe, the Garda Lake was the most beautiful place in Italy, Punta San Vigilio is without a doubt the most beautiful place in the entire world.” Agostino Brenzone</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can head north along Garda’s promenade and walk along to Punta San Vigilio, renowned as one of the most beautiful parts of Lake Garda or the world as above suggests. Some parts of the path are flooded so do bear in mind that you will have to get your feet wet in order to get to the end of the path where the San Vigilio hotel is located but the hotel is highly acclaimed and has been resident to Vivian Leigh of Gone With The Wind fame, Winston Churchill and Prince Charles. There you will find a terraced restaurant to enjoy a well-deserved cold drink and to enjoy the views.</p>
<p>Top tips:</p>
<p>Wear shoes that you don’t mind getting wet (sandals)</p>
<p>Bring a few extra Euros and enjoy a drink at the restaurant overlooking the lake.</p>
<h3>Stairway to scenery: Rocca Vecchia</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13062948/sirmione_big.jpg" alt="lake garda walking routes" data-udi="umb://media/7661477f394341c8856ab2c21f45b5cc" /></p>
<p>Starting to the right of the church in the centre of Garda, the walk up La Rocca is a must do while in town. The overgrown Stairways lead up to spectacular views over Garda up towards Punta San Vigilo and down to Bardolino and on a cloudless day, across to Sirmione. It takes about 1 hour to ascend, however if you want to take it at a more leisurely pace there are regular benches along the way where you can rest and enjoy the views. There are also various routes you can take that lead up to the viewpoint so you may wish to do an alternative route on the way down (These are all sign posted).</p>
<p>Top tips:</p>
<p>Wear suitable sturdy footwear, the paths are uneven and there is loose gravel in parts (sandals not recommended).</p>
<p>Take a picnic, when you get to the top you will understand why!</p>
<p>Bring your camera to capture some wonderful panoramic views of Garda.</p>
<p>The area has a vast array of walking routes so if you have exhausted these favourites you might wish to pop to the tourist office and pick up one of their walking brochures or head up to Malcesine and hike up Monte Baldo! Happy hiking! Sarah 🙂 Words by Sarah MacLachlan, Resort Representative in Gardaolino</p>]]></bodyText>
