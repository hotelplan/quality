When you’re finished with the heat in the sauna, dive into the cold ice fountain for an invigorating energy kick!<br /><br />There is also the ‘Bamboo’ sauna park for an opulent far eastern experience with the Thai sauna and the salt water grotto. While you’re there, try out the herbal sauna with aromas and essences mixed into the steam in the air for a relaxing and breathe-easy experience. <br /><br />If the heat of the Alpine sauna doesn’t appeal to you, the hotel also offers an open air salt water bath, kept at 35°c all year around and the ‘Petit Oubli’- a space for pure relaxation on waterbeds while listening to your favourite music.<br /><br /><strong>Top tip: </strong>Make the most of the salt water bath. The spring water of the bath is mixed with 2.7% natural brine which is thought to promote health and rehabilitation following illness and injury.</p>

<p><span id="2" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">If you fancy... a planet-friendly green retreat</span><br /><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">Hotel Theresia in Hinterglemm, Austria</span> <br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064730/_0002_th_sauna3.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/38229934b82c467892c63f286741828b" /><br /><br />Like lots of people these days, we are wary about being green and ecological. <br /><br />And not just eco side of things, there is also a strong desire for the back-to-basics approach to beauty. Chemical-free and organic skin products are gracing the shelves of spas and clinics around the world and many people prefer the refreshing holistic approach to their health and mindfulness. <br /><br />The Theresia SPA at the <a href="/{localLink:ac6ef4f4-563a-4b54-81b2-27758ff71b87}" title="Gardenhotel Theresia (Hinterglemm)">Hotel Theresia</a> in <a href="/{localLink:534192b1-67d2-474c-b617-d4ef57263557}" title="Saalbach &amp; Hinterglemm">Hinterglemm</a> in <a href="/{localLink:e0ef1ac2-0952-43d7-9b08-6183c41fc451}" title="Austria">Austria </a>has adopted exactly that approach to the running of their spa retreat. They proudly stock the German line of eco-certified cosmetics Annemarie Börlind Natural Cosmetics and the organically-certified Austrian cosmetic brand of Marías. <br /><br />At the Hotel Theresia you can enjoy some beautiful natural outdoor swimming pools, treated with the minimum amount of chlorine and heated using an energy-recycling system from the hotel. For total relaxation, the kids’ swimming pool is separate from the adults. <br /><br />The hotel also harnesses the power of two mountain springs, both which provide soft glacial water- fantastic for the more sensitive skin types. The water is fed into the inside and the outside pools, the whirlpool and the natural swimming pond. <br /><br />And finally, once you are exhausted of splashing about in the beautiful spa facilities, you can enjoy some quiet meditation in the Tranquillity Pyramid- a conservatory full of light and harnessing the energy of the sun. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip:</strong> Most saunas are strictly for adults only. The Hotel Theresia has kids’ facilities and swimming pools, so sit back and relax. Enjoy your uninterrupted time in the ‘Whisper Zone’ in the sauna. <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #7ea537;">Hotel Salzburgerhof in Zell am See, Austria</span> <br /><br /><img style="width: 500px; height: 238.69047619047617px;" src="/media/13064722/_0000_zas_3038_salzburgerhof-solebad.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.69047619047617" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/4f643875549d4aeabee4674d60b85a41" /><br /><br />At the spa in the <a href="/{localLink:8d08a541-fdb5-43fe-909f-98051d49af84}" title="Hotel Salzburgerhof">Hotel Salzburgerhof</a>, you are encouraged to focus on yourself, find your inner harmony and happiness, all while receiving 5-star treatment. <br /><br />The truly indulgent pampering spa is proud of its ‘Wellness Castle’- this building, with over 3,500m² floorspace, is dedicated to wellness and focused on enjoying recreational time. A relaxing space where meditation and calm is encouraged with warm waterbeds and loungers, it is the perfect opportunity to really connect with your inner thoughts in this peaceful location. <br /><br />There is also an extended sauna area, a steam bath as well as a lengthy pool area outdoors with a whirlpool, athletic pool, Jacuzzi and an invigoratingly cool waterfall. <br /><br />For ultimate relaxation, why not indulge in the Salzburgerhof’s Salt Water Dome? The practice of floating in the dark, tranquil space is similar to that of a sensory deprivation experience: find peace and calm within your mind by abandoning all worldly sensations. You’ll be surrounded by candles, soft lighting installations, gentle music and floating in highly concentrated salt waters akin to those of the Dead Sea. All together you will be transported into a state of deep relaxation in both mind and body. <br /><br />You can either float on your own in the Salt Water Dome or you can have an assisted floating session with a trained professional, who will lead you through a variety of gentle stretching exercises to grasp your inner state of calm. <br /><br /><strong>Top tip:</strong> For a real deep breathing exercise, try the experience in the Dragons Grotto. A cocktail of steam, oxygen and fragrance in the air makes this a real detoxifying treatment for your lungs and sinuses.   <br /><br /><a href="#top">^ Return to top </a></p>
