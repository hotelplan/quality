<h3>Our Favourite Walks in Kandersteg</h3>
<p><strong>Oeschinensee's Easy Loop</strong></p>
<p>The Oeschinensee Circular Walk is a gentle 4km journey, with a bit of uphill and downhill (about 110m each way), and it usually takes about an hour—unless you find yourself mesmerized by the lake and decide to linger longer.</p>
<p>This lake isn't just any lake; it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known for its unreal beauty. <br />Starting from the top of the Oeschinen gondola station, you can follow the main path that's pretty straightforward and great for everyone.</p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not take the scenic route via Läger? Whichever way you choose, you'll be greeted by the stunning sight of bright blue water set against dramatic mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a leisurely stroll along the shore, grab a bite or a drink at the lakeside restaurant, have a picnic by one of the grill spots, or even rent a rowing boat for a little adventure on the water.</p>
<p>And if walking's not your thing, no worries! There's an e-shuttle bus that can zip you back to the gondola station every 30 minutes for about CHF8 per person.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Kandersteg to Gasterntal</strong></p>
<p>This is a moderate hike, stretching 8 kilometres with an ascent of about 475m. You'll want to set aside around 3 hours for this walk, though you might find yourself wanting to explore deeper into Gasterntal.</p>
<p>This walk is perfect from June to October, when the trails are at their best. Starting from the Sunnbüel cable car base station, you'll follow a path that hugs the mighty Kander river, cutting through the dramatic Klus gorge. Prepare to be awed by the waterfalls showcasing the river's raw power.</p>
<p>As you meander through a wildlife reserve, the trail will take you up through a forest, opening up to a breathtaking mountain panorama that seems to stretch on forever. The path then eases as you follow the River Kander through the valley, letting you choose how far you want to go.<br />Ready to head back? You can either retrace your steps or hop on a bus back to Kandersteg (just remember to book your bus ticket in advance).</p>
<p>And if you're looking for a change of scenery, why not do the hike in reverse? Catch the bus to Gasterntal and walk your way back to the village.</p>
<p> </p>
