<h2>Summer Activities in Samoëns</h2>

<p>Samoëns is perfect for a <a data-udi="umb://document/7dbdfaaa8cb844fab907811da9fe4079" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7dbdfaaa8cb844fab907811da9fe4079}" title="Family Holidays">family holiday</a>.

<p> </p>
<h2 id="sightseeing" style="text-align: left;">Sightseeing</h2>
<p>The Lime-Light of Samoëns In the heart of Samoëns stands the Gros Tilleul, a lime tree that's been playing village VIP for nearly 600 years. This leafy celebrity has seen it all, from market days to grand events. Get your camera ready, you’ll want to take a photo of this all natural superstar.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="alpine" style="text-align: left;">The Alpine Botanical Garden, ‘La Jaÿsinia’</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13103104/adobestock_252025247.jpg" alt="summer things to do in samoens" data-udi="umb://media/8418ef15453844d6a9efce7e5cabf818" /></p>
<p>When in Samoëns, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.samoens.com/en/alpine-botanical-garden-la-jaysinia/" target="_blank" title="La Jaysinia">La Jaÿsinia</a> is a must-see. It’s a chance to immerse yourself in the magic of nature and history, all in one go.</p>
<p>Created in 1906 by the founder of La Samaritaine, Marie-Louise Cognacq-Jaÿ, it's a living, blooming encyclopedia of mountain plants.</p>
<p>Managed by the big brains at the National Museum of Natural History, this garden is serious about its flora. La Jaÿsinia is home to 4,800 mountain plants from around the globe, spanning over 2,500 species.</p>
<p>Perched on a southern slope overlooking the village, stretching across 3.7 hectares, the garden is a steep climb with an 80-meter rise. But it’s worth every step.</p>
<p>But La Jaÿsinia is more than just plants.</p>
<p>It's a place of study, a tranquil oasis, and a window into local history. Since 1936, it's been under the scientific watch of the National Museum of Natural History. It even boasts a laboratory open to scientists, with a collection of plants from Savoie and the Alps in herbariums.</p>
<p>And there’s more than just greenery. The garden is a scenic marvel with impressive fountains, waterfalls, and trees.</p>
<p>It's also home to the ruins of La Tornalta (or Montanier) Castle from the 12th century and a quaint 18th-century chapel. These historic gems are visible from the charming path winding through the garden.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="summer" style="text-align: left;">Summer Events</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13103108/zoe-samoëns-lake.jpg" alt="samoens lake" data-udi="umb://media/63e35924b65149dcb4e8cc413ae66ffb" /></p>
<p>The summer season rolls in with a bang, celebrating everything from pedal-pushing mountain bikers and blooming alpine plants to music and wellness vibes.</p>
<p>And the grand finale? La Rioule – it's a whirl of folk dancing and a slippery, greasy pole-climbing contest that's wildly competitive. Visit by their <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.samoens.com/en/diary/" target="_blank" title="Visit Samoens">website</a> to view the upcoming events calendar and see what's on the summertime agenda.</p>
<p>Looking for a spot to unwind? Head over to Samoëns’ lake, a quaint, turquoise beauty that’s just a quick walk from the centre. This charming lake is split into three areas, with a special nook dedicated to swimming.</p>
<p>It’s a local favourite, so you’ll spot folks paddle boarding or just relaxing by the water.</p>
<p>Whether you fancy a gentle lakeside stroll, or a refreshing swim, this lake is your go-to for a dose of relaxation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="reserve" style="text-align: left;">The Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval Nature Reserve</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13103110/zoe-sixt-fer-à-cheval.jpg" alt="things to do in samoens" data-udi="umb://media/924fbdb4ba0443d1a64dcbdb8c4814ee" /></p>
<p>Love the great outdoors? Step into the Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval Nature Reserve. Getting there is a breeze during the busy times with regular buses, or you can always grab a taxi for a more direct route.</p>
<p>Once you're there, it's a walker’s paradise with trails for every level. If you're into easy-going walks, the valley-level paths are your ticket to scenic bliss. But for the adventurous souls who like a challenge, there are tougher trails calling your name.</p>
<p>And for a real treat, trek to “Bout de Monde” or “the end of the world.” It's not as scary as it sounds – instead, you'll be greeted with jaw-dropping views, majestic peaks, and waterfalls that dance down the rocks. It's like stepping into a whole other world, right in the heart of the Alps.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="biking" style="text-align: left;">E-Biking</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13103112/adobestock_286588519.jpg" alt="e-biking in samoens" data-udi="umb://media/0f328d423864413f9ea386efdc0a87f0" /></p>
<p>Ever thought of exploring Samoëns on two wheels? E-biking is a fantastic way to zip around the local area, especially with the flatter valleys that are just begging to be explored.</p>
<p>And if you're feeling bold and want to venture up into the mountains, well, that's where the 'E' in E-biking comes to your rescue. Let the electric boost carry you up those slopes. Picture yourself cruising through quaint nearby villages, stopping off at cosy Boulangeries (French bakery) to indulge in some delicious local pastries.</p>
<p>Also, remember to check out the waterfalls – they’re amazing and worth the trip. Samoëns has lots of beautiful waterfalls, especially because it's lower down in the Alps. You can usually see them from May to September, but they’re at their most beautiful in June.</p>
<p>E-bikes are readily available for hire right in town. You can easily book one and sort out the payment locally. So, get ready to pedal (with a little help from some electric power) and uncover the hidden charms of Samoëns in the most fun and eco-friendly way possible.</p>
