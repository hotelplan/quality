<p><img src="/media/13108415/traditional-norwegian-food.jpg" alt="traditional Norwegian food" data-udi="umb://media/79b50a2ab00a441d8ad735bff4159187" /></p>
<p>Curious about traditional Norwegian food? <a data-udi="umb://document/286d71b6bae94f84a7ac63448c015f54" href="/{localLink:umb://document/286d71b6bae94f84a7ac63448c015f54}" title="Norway">Norway</a>, known for its stunning fjords and rich history, also has a delicious food scene.</p>
<p>While seafood is a standout (hello king crab and salmon, plus Norway’s famous Atlantic cod, Skrei), there’s so much more to explore.</p>
<h3>Traditional Norwegian food with Fjords of flavour</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108420/lutefisk-served-with-pea-puree-potatoes-and-bacon-close-up.jpg" alt="lutefisk norwegian food" data-udi="umb://media/10753775bad042d2a6c322b600852b8a" /></p>
<p><em>Image: Lutefisk served with pea puree, potatoes and bacon.</em></p>
<p>The country’s harsh winters and rugged terrain have given rise to hearty dishes that have been passed down through generations.</p>
<p>Lamb is a local favourite, celebrated for its tenderness and rich flavour. And if you have a sweet tooth, you’re in for a treat with Norwegian buns, waffles, and ciders.</p>
<p>For something more savoury, don’t miss out on the cured meats and some of their finest cheeses like Brunost.</p>
<h3>Four meals a day, the Norwegian way.</h3>
<p>Norwegian meal times differ from other countries and it’s often common to have up to 4 meals a day.</p>
<p><strong>Frokost (Breakfast):</strong> Typically cold, featuring cereals, yoghurt, fruit, and bread with toppings like cheese or jam.</p>
<p><strong>Lunsj (Lunch):</strong> Usually a packed meal called "matpakke," often sandwiches, leftovers, or fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Middag (Dinner):</strong> The main meal of the day, served warm between 4-6 pm. It can be anything from fish to meat dishes with sides like potatoes and vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>Kveldsmat (Supper):</strong> A lighter meal eaten between 6-8 pm, though not as common as the other meals.</p>
<p>Hungry yet? Here’s some dishes you’ll want to try if you want to eat like a local in Norway...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Traditional Norweigan food you must try</h2>
<h3>Bread: Loaves of options</h3>
<p>Norwegians love their bread, and it's not just any bread. They have a loaf of options! From fluffy "loff" to hearty "grovbrød" and even crunchy "knekkebrød," there's something for every bread lover.</p>
<h4>Smørrebrød: Open sandwiches</h4>
<p><img src="/media/13108412/smoerrebroed.jpg" alt="norway open sandwich" data-udi="umb://media/98b1a3baf57d4b0c875d1c2b1e5d6ebf" /></p>
<p>Norway's smørrebrød, a more humble open-faced sandwich compared to its Nordic counterparts, often features simple toppings like cheese or jam.</p>
<p>Yet, it's not always so plain. Dressed up for special occasions, Smørrebrød platters often serve as a casual and convenient dinner option in Norway, especially for gatherings.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Norway's catch - the land of fjords and flavoursome fish</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108411/norwegian-fish.jpg" alt="norway fish" data-udi="umb://media/5666f486d19140d8bd6ab0d7c6cf9d3b" /></p>
<p>Fish is a staple in Norway, thanks to the country's long and beautiful coastline. You can enjoy fish in all sorts of delicious ways, like smoked salmon, gravlax, and rakfisk.</p>
<p>While halibut might be reserved for special occasions, cod is the everyday champion, popping up in tasty fish cakes and hearty soups.</p>
<h4>Bergen: A seafood sensation</h4>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5}" title="Bergen">Bergen</a> is a special place for food lovers. <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.visitbergen.com/food-and-drink/bergen-city-of-gastronomy" target="_blank" title="UNESCO Gastronomy">It's been named a UNESCO City of Gastronomy</a>, which means it's famous for its delicious food and cooking traditions.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Bergen so special is its seafood. The ocean around the city is full of tasty mussels, scallops, and fresh fish.</p>
<p>You can try traditional dishes like Bergen fish soup or "persetorsk," which is cod that's been marinated in salt and sugar.</p>
<p>For a real taste of the region, don’t miss the Bergen Food Festival which usually takes place in September. It’s a great chance to explore the best local food.</p>
<h4>Stockfish: Bergen’s golden export</h4>
<p>Stockfish, a dried cod, has been important in Norway’s history as the country’s first big export, helping Bergen grow as a trading hub.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known dishes made with stockfish is lutefisk, a traditional Christmas meal where the fish is soaked until it becomes jelly-like. It's often paired with bacon or pea stew to improve the flavour.</p>
<p>Stockfish is also enjoyed as a snack, sold in small, dried flakes at select fishmongers in Bergen.</p>
<h4>Mountain Trout: A catch of the Day</h4>
<p>Norway’s clear mountain lakes are full of trout, a key ingredient in local dishes. Hunters' and fishermen's associations ensure healthy trout populations, allowing visitors with a permit to catch their own meal. </p>
<p>Look for small local cafés along country roads, especially near Bergen, where many serve "crispy mountain trout" freshly caught from nearby lakes - a perfect summer treat.</p>
<h4>Crayfish: A Fjordland delicacy</h4>
<p>Norway's fjords are home to another tasty treat: crayfish. These small relatives of lobsters have a similar, delicious flavor, and the western fjords are perfect for them.</p>
<p>In Bergen, which is close to the coast, you can find fresh crayfish. Once an easy catch, crayfish are now a popular and expensive delicacy, with some people liking their taste even more than lobster.</p>
<h4>Rakfisk: Love it or hate it</h4>
<p>Rakfisk is a traditional Norwegian dish made from fermented trout. It has a strong smell and taste, but many people love it.</p>
<p>To make rakfisk, trout fillets are salted and layered in wooden barrels, covered with spruce branches, and left to ferment for months.</p>
<p>Rakfisk is often eaten with lefse, a flatbread, and served with butter, sour cream, and a salad of onion and beetroot.</p>
<p>If you enjoy bold flavours, you might like rakfisk. It’s a flavourful dish, perfect for anyone looking to try something different.</p>
<h4>Persetorsk: A Bergen tradition</h4>
<p>Persetorsk, or "pressed cod," is a traditional dish from Bergen made by rubbing fresh cod fillets with salt and sugar, then pressing them for hours to create a tender texture.</p>
<p>It’s typically served with egg, butter, boiled potatoes, and carrots.</p>
<p>Though this centuries-old dish has deep roots, it’s now experiencing a revival. Many Bergen restaurants offer creative versions of Persetorsk, adding ingredients like peas or creamy butter sauce.</p>
<p>To celebrate this iconic dish, Bergen’s City Council declared January 28th as Persetorsk Day, honoring its place in Norway’s culinary heritage.</p>
<h4>Prince Fish: A royal dish</h4>
<p>Prince fish is a classic Norwegian dish with a royal history. It was first served in 1856 to Crown Prince Carl of Sweden-Norway and Crown Prince Wilhelm of Orange during their visit to Bergen.</p>
<p>Freshly caught cod is the main ingredient in Prince Fish. It’s lightly salted and gently cooked, then served with a rich cream sauce that creates a delicious combination of flavours.</p>
<h4>Smoked Herring: A classic snack</h4>
<p>Smoked herring, known as "bøkling," is another popular Norwegian treat.</p>
<p>Traditionally, smoking was a way to preserve fish, and it is still a favoured method today. While you can find smoked herring all year round thanks to cold storage, it tastes best when made with fresh fish, especially in winter and early summer.</p>
<p>Bøkling is usually sold without the head, tail, or bones, making it a convenient snack. You can enjoy it on its own, with wholemeal bread, or with boiled potatoes and a bit of sour cream for a simple but satisfying meal.</p>
<h4>Rokt Las: A taste of Norway's salmon</h4>
<p><img src="/media/13108408/norwegian-salmon.jpg" alt="norway salmon" data-udi="umb://media/211daa88933043039ea527ca18f5ee6e" /></p>
<p>Norway is a major producer of salmon.</p>
<p>Both farmed and wild salmon are plentiful in Norwegian waters, and you'll find it served in many ways throughout the country. One of the most popular dishes is Rokt Laks, or smoked salmon.</p>
<p>Smoking is a traditional way of preserving food in Norway that dates back centuries, giving the salmon a unique flavour and texture.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy it as a smoked salmon sandwich, a starter with capers and cream cheese, or as part of a larger meal, Rokt Laks is a must-try for anyone visiting Norway.</p>
<h3>Kjøttboller: Norwegian meatballs</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108407/kjoettboller.jpg" alt="norwegian meatballs" data-udi="umb://media/09b5b7599f0847848c1d0d2dc11ceabf" /></p>
<p>Kjøttboller, or Norwegian meatballs, are similar to Swedish meatballs but have their own distinct flavour. While both use ground meat, kjøttboller often include ginger or nutmeg.</p>
<p>Meatballs are made by rolling ground meat into balls and mixing in ingredients like breadcrumbs, onions, eggs, butter, and seasonings.</p>
<p>They can be cooked in various ways, including frying, baking, steaming, or braising in a sauce. There are many types of meatballs, each using different meats and spices to create unique tastes.</p>
<h3>Multer: Norway's golden berries</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108406/multer-berries.jpg" alt="norway cloudberries" data-udi="umb://media/a616853826f2431d86502320808a05ca" /></p>
<p>Cloudberries, or multer in Norwegian, are a prized delicacy in Norway. They are often called "Arctic Gold" due to their rarity and unique flavour. These golden berries are found in the alpine tundra and boreal forests of Norway.</p>
<p>They are a distinctive fruit with a sharp, tangy taste when raw. However, when cooked, their flavour becomes savoury and almost spicy. Cloudberries are highly valued in Norwegian cuisine and are often used in jams, preserves, and desserts.</p>
<p>They also complement the rich flavours of game meats like reindeer and lamb.</p>
<h3>Brunost: A Norwegian staple</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108414/brunost-cheese.jpg" alt="brunost" data-udi="umb://media/06fab0b3961f4f35b2fa2519c0d38877" /></p>
<p>One of Norway’s most fascinating foods, especially to foreigners, is brunost, or Norwegian brown cheese.</p>
<p>Many Norwegians enjoy it daily for breakfast, lunch, or as a snack. Brunost is a unique brown cheese with a sweet, caramel-like flavour that makes it a beloved treat, often paired with waffles or spread on bread. Its distinctive colour comes from caramelising milk sugars during production.</p>
<p>The taste is soft yet sharp, blending sweetness with a hint of tang, making it hard to define. Visitors often compare its flavour to dulce de leche, and it’s a taste that people either love or dislike.</p>
<p>For centuries, brunost has been crafted with the help of goats and cows, becoming a cultural favourite that truly embodies the essence of Norway’s mountains, fjords, and farming traditions.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13108419/waffles-with-norwegian-brunost.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/96b32c9ec8a44be7845d8e47bfc6f011" /></p>
<p><em>Image: Waffles with Norwegian brunost traditional brown cheese and raspberry jam.</em></p>
<p>This caramel-coloured cheese has even gained international recognition. The brown cheese from Stordalen Gardsbruk even won a silver medal at the World Cheese Awards in 2018.</p>
<p>So, if you find yourself in Norway, you can't miss the chance to try Brunost.</p>
<h3>Fårikål: Norway's hearty national dish</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108416/faarikaal.jpg" alt="mutton stew" data-udi="umb://media/f6a2bfbae7a04abe897b22d37e79548c" /></p>
<p>Fårikål, Norway's national dish, is a hearty stew made with mutton and cabbage. It's a celebration of the country's free-range sheep, which graze on a variety of herbs and plants.</p>
<p>This gives the mutton a rich flavour and tender texture. The recipe for Fårikål is simple but delicious. Mutton and cabbage are slow-cooked together and seasoned with black peppercorns and is typically served with boiled potatoes and a tangy lingonberry sauce.</p>
<p>This traditional dish is enjoyed by Norwegians, especially as the weather starts to get colder. It's celebrated on the last Thursday of September with Fårikål Feast Day.</p>
<h3>A Taste of Voss: Smalahove and Vossakorv</h3>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/3bff04d1881648b5a6163cdd11cfb562" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3bff04d1881648b5a6163cdd11cfb562}" title="Voss">Voss</a> is a beautiful area in Norway known for its tasty traditional food. Two of the most unique dishes are smalahove, which is a smoked sheep's head, and vossakorv, a delicious smoked sausage.</p>
<p>These dishes show how the locals preserved food by smoking it, a skill that became important during tough times.</p>
<p>Smalahove is a one-of-a-kind dish. It’s made by salt-curing, smoking, and steaming the sheep's head, and it's usually served whole with potatoes, mashed swedes, beer, and aquavit.</p>
<h3>Raspeballer: A Thursday tradition</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108401/raspeballer.jpg" alt="raspeballer" data-udi="umb://media/a45dced652e3494eb9edac7cc1cbe482" /></p>
<p>Raspeballer, or komler, are a popular Norwegian dish that's often served on Thursdays. The tradition of eating raspeballer on Thursdays dates back to the days when shops in Bergen stayed open late.</p>
<p>Raspeballer are boiled potato dumplings that are typically served with salted meat. In <a data-udi="umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5}" title="Bergen">Bergen</a>, they're often accompanied by Vossa sausage, cabbage radish, and bacon. Many people also enjoy drinking sour milk with their raspeballer.</p>
<p>If you're visiting Bergen on a Thursday, be sure to try this hearty and delicious Norwegian dish.</p>
<h3>Vafler: Norway's heart shaped waffle</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108405/vafler-waffle.jpg" alt="Vafler waffle" data-udi="umb://media/391d87eb9c1b452384e177b4c7e8805d" /></p>
<p>Vafler, or Norwegian waffles, are a cherished treat in Norway. Unlike Belgian or American waffles, vafler are heart-shaped.</p>
<p>These delicious waffles are often topped with sour cream and jam, butter and sweet brown cheese, or whipped cream with berries or chocolate syrup.</p>
<p>Vafler can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dessert - so why not try them for all three? When in Norway...</p>
<h3>Boller: Sweet buns</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108404/boller-sweet-buns.jpg" alt="boller sweet buns" data-udi="umb://media/17b3e302eb7340a0bec07ab451dfeaeb" /></p>
<p>Boller is a popular Norwegian sweet bun that might look plain but is packed with flavour. Don’t judge a bun by its cover. You can find these tasty treats almost everywhere in Norway - bakeries, cafés, shops, and even petrol stations. Norwegians love their fluffy boller.</p>
<h3>Lefse: The Norwegian pancake</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108418/norway-lefse.jpg" alt="lefse" data-udi="umb://media/7ea594919baa406388bcb5ab7f4c52ca" /></p>
<p>Ever heard of Lefse? It's Norway's answer to the pancake!</p>
<p>Made with flour, potatoes, butter, and cream, lefse can be enjoyed sweet or savoury - so why not try both?</p>
<p>For a sweet treat, try it with cinnamon, sugar, or jam. On the savoury side, lefse makes the perfect wrap for smoked salmon and sour cream.</p>
<p>Some Norwegians even fill it with ham, cheese, or beef for a heartier bite. However you eat it, this delicious flatbread is a must-try.</p>
<h3>Skolebrød: A sweet school treat</h3>
<p>Skolebrød, a beloved Norwegian treat, is a sweet bun filled with a delicious vanilla custard. It's topped with icing and shredded coconut, making it a perfect choice for those with a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>It's believed to have originated in the 1950s as a school lunchbox treat. Today, you can find skolebrød in bakeries, supermarkets, and small village shops across the country.</p>
<p>The name skolebrød actually varies slightly across different regions of Norway. It's known as skolebolle in western Norway and as skolebrød in the north, east, and Vestfold-Telemark.</p>
<p>In Arctic Norway, a similar cake is made to celebrate the return of the sun in the spring.</p>
<h3>Cinnamon Buns: A Bergen delight</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108403/cinnamon-buns.jpg" alt="cinnamon buns" data-udi="umb://media/cc18457e31fd4d558d86e072838c0c4a" /></p>
<p>Spiral-shaped sweet pastries with cinnamon are a common treat in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>However, Bergen's cinnamon buns have a special something that sets them apart. These cinnamon buns are known for their generous size, ample amounts of sugar and cinnamon, and fluffy, juicy dough. And unlike cinnamon buns from other parts of Europe, Bergen's buns are typically made without raisins.</p>
<p>There are two ways to enjoy a Bergen cinnamon bun: you can eat it across the spirals like a regular bun, or you can unroll the spirals and bite off the end one by one. Yum.</p>
<h3>Sveler: Norway's fluffy pancakes</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108402/pancake.jpg" alt="Sveler norway pancake" data-udi="umb://media/3c083a85b0154522b3befa7167109d12" /></p>
<p>Sveler, thick and fluffy pancakes, are a popular Norwegian treat. They're often served with the same toppings as waffles, like jam, sour cream, or brown cheese. You can also enjoy them with a simple butter and sugar mix.</p>
<p>You can find them in many cafes across Norway, as well as onboard most ferries.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Traditional Norwegian Drinks</h2>
<h3>Solo Drink</h3>
<p>One of the standout non-alcoholic soft drinks in Norway is Solo, a refreshing orange-flavoured drink that's often compared to Fanta.</p>
<p>Loved throughout the country, Solo was even more popular than Coca-Cola before the 1960s and now proudly ranks as the third most popular non-alcoholic drink in Norway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Solo's original recipe comes from Spain, but it was the Norwegians who turned it into a Scandinavian favourite.</p>
<h3>Aquavit</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13108399/aquavit-cocktail.jpg" alt="aquavit cocktail" data-udi="umb://media/fe6fa4b1b51d43fdbad58783ea24cdec" /></p>
<p><em>A refreshing summer cocktail made with traditional Scandinavian Akvavit, a smooth vodka-based spirit. </em></p>
<p>When it comes to Norwegian spirits, Aquavit, often called Akvavit, takes the spotlight. This distinctive liquor, made from potatoes and grains, is a staple at festive occasions like Christmas and weddings.</p>
<p>You can also try Aquavit in a variety of classic cocktails, such as "Driven Snow" and "Olof Palme."</p>
<h3>Mead</h3>
<p>Mead, or mjød, has been a beloved part of Scandinavian festivities since Viking times. Often called "honey wine," this drink is sweetened primarily with honey, giving it that special flavour.</p>
<p>In the winter months, it's traditionally enjoyed warm, paired perfectly with ginger biscuits.</p>
<h3>Punsch</h3>
<p>"Punsch," a popular Scandinavian drink that started in the 18th century, is named after a Hindi word meaning "five." This is because it's made with five things: alcohol, water, sugar, fruit, and spices.</p>
<p>You can also add special liqueurs to give it a different flavour, like almond, chocolate, or banana. Many people like to drink warm punch in the winter.</p>
<h3>Pilsner</h3>
<p>Pilsner is one of the most beloved Norwegian beers. You’ll even find local breweries in small towns like Flam, where visitors love to try the unique Aegir beers. It’s a great way to taste the local flavour.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Take time to savour Norway</h2>
<p>You’ll find that the flavours of Norway are just as memorable as its stunning landscapes.</p>
