<p>Slovenia has some 28,000 wineries, mostly small independent businesses, producing some of Europe’s finest wines but sadly, very little is exported. If you’re a wine buff or someone who just likes the odd tipple, this is your chance to get to know this beautiful country and learn more about its history, people, its castles - and of course, its delicious wines.</p>

<h2>Itinerary</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DAY 1 SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p>Fly to Trieste from Stansted and transfer to your accommodation in Karst, our first wine region. Meet your fellow guests and your Inghams Explorer guide. Rest of the day at leisure to explore the Karst region, 300m above sea level and strongly characterized by the red soil Terra Rossa and the Bora wind.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 2 SUNDAY </strong></p>
<p>The Karst wine region straddles Italy and Slovenia. First stop is a family run winery on the Italian side before a stop in a Gostilna inn for a lunch with typical dry-cured ham. On the way back to Slovenian Karst, we’ll stop for our second tasting of the day. We will taste Vitovska Grganja and the mineral wine Teran, the most distinctive wine varieties of this region.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 3 MONDAY</strong></p>
<p>A morning visit to two beautiful castles set on a cliff top overlooking the Adriatic Sea. Miramare Castle was formerly the residence of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximillian of Hapsburg whilst the second, the 14th century Duino Castle, is still the private residence of the Princesa della Torre y Tasso. After a lunch with homemade specialities, we will continue to the second wine region Goriska Brda. Afternoon at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 TUESDAY</strong></p>
<p>This morning we’ll explore the Goriska Brda wine region. Pretty villages cling precariously to the hilltops, while vineyards mix with forests and orchards. Visit medieval Smartno, with its lookout tower with panoramic views of the Alps and the Adriatic followed by a visit to a cool wine cellar, where top-class Slovenian wines mature. Afternoon at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 5 WEDNESDAY</strong></p>
<p>Some serious wine tasting today! This area is renowned for its white wines and the reds must be regarded as some of the best in the world. Sample some delicious Italian wines before a pleasant stroll by Spessa castle. After a delicious lunch with seasonal fresh ingredients, in the afternoon we get a chance to sample some fine Slovenian sparkling wines.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 6 THURSDAY</strong></p>
<p>Drive to Vipava Valley, the third wine region, where the vines have been grown since the Roman times. In Zalosce we’ll collect our picnics and stroll through the olive groves, peach trees and of course the vineyards. On the way along the Vipava Valley Wine Road we will stop at a family run winery to taste delicious indigenous wines such as fruity Zelen and fresh Pinela, both of them made with carefully hand-picked grapes.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 7 FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p>The border runs between Gorizia (Italy) and Nove Gorica (Slovenia) and here we’ll visit the Corinini Cronberg Palace with its English style garden or the medieval Gorizia castle which dominates the town. After stopping at the monastery where the last French Bourbon kings are buried we’ll stop at a wine store for our final wine tasting.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 8 SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p>Morning transfer back to Trieste for your flight home or extend your stay by staying in Piran or Portoroz.</p>
