<p>Veneto is in the northeast of Italy and is of course well known, as home to the floating city of Venice. Our tour is based in the walled town of Castelfranco which is also handily linked by rail to Venice and other places of interest and we include a couple of days at leisure so that you can either rest or explore further afield under your own steam. The whole region was once under the mighty Serenissima meaning there are many more gems to be found here, such as the architectural treasures of Vincenza and the Giotto frescoes of Padua.</p>

<h2>Itinerary</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> | Arrive on your chosen flight to Venice and transfer to the Hotel Alla Torre in Castelfranco Veneto. In the evening meet your Tour Manager and fellow travellers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong> | A short drive away lies the pretty town of <strong>Asolo</strong>, known as 'the town of a hundred horizons' for its wonderful mountain views. Loved by residents Freya Stark and Robert Browning, it's also home to works by Venetian artists Giorgione and Veronese.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong> | The nearby city of <strong>Vicenza</strong> has a wealth of neo-classical treasures by the 16th century architect Andrea Palladio. A walking tour of the centre will visit the Teatro Olimpico and the Basilica. In the afternoon we'll head out to the countryside to visit Palladio's famous villa, La Rotonda (subject to availability), which so influenced 17th century British style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong> | There is a chance to relax today and explore the delights of medieval <strong>Castelfranco</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong> | The beautiful city of <strong>Padua</strong> lies less than an hour's drive away and today we'll visit with a local guide the famous Scrovengi Chapel to see amazing 14th century frescoes by Giotto. There will then be time to visit the historical city centre and the Basilica where St Anthony of Padua lies buried. Before heading home we have time to see the world's oldest botanical garden created in 1545 and now a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong> | Fruity, sparkling <strong>Prosecco</strong> has become very popular lately and so today we learn a little more about it with a visit to the vineyards of the <strong>Conegliano</strong> and <strong>Valdobbiadene</strong> regions. The landscape is beautiful with ancient villages, churches and impressive abbeys surrounded by splendid vines. We visit the cellars of a winemaker and enjoy wine tasting and a light lunch of local products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong> | Today you have another opportunity to relax in <strong>Castelfranco</strong> or you could choose to take a train to visit the inimitable city of Venice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong> | Transfer to Venice airport for your flight home or continue with your holiday by enjoying one of our great destinations such as Venice, Florence or Lake Garda.</p>
