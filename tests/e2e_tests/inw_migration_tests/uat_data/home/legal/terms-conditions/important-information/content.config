Travel insurance is essential on any holiday and it is a condition of booking that you have travel insurance offering at least equivalent or superior cover to that offered by Campbell Irvine Travel Insurance, details of which can be viewed on the Insurance pages of our websites. You should also ensure that your policy offers cover for any personal requirements and the type of holiday you have chosen.<br /><br />Different policies are available for UK and non-UK residents, so please check the details carefully. Insurance policies usually specify the maximum amount covered in the event of any loss or damage and most do not cover mobile telephones and may have exclusions for certain “extreme” sports. Please note that many policies offered free by banks and credit card companies do not cover winter sports in their standard cover. Should you opt for an alternative policy that does not satisfy this, we will not be held liable for any costs, expenses or damages normally covered by the Campbell Irvine Travel Insurance policy which includes cancellation, curtailment and expenses resulting from a delayed journey to/from resort, mountain rescue and repatriation. We therefore suggest that you check the limits of cover of your chosen policy. Reciprocal arrangements for medical assistance are available in some EU countries by virtue of the EHIC or GHIC card. You should check that your policy, or any existing policy, does not have exclusions in place based on the EHIC/GHIC card or use of public hospitals. <br /><br />Any alternative policy must not expire until after the return date to the UK and we recommend that you arrange your insurance at the same time as confirming your booking, to ensure that you are covered from the outset.<br /><br />If you are unsure of the arrangements for medical treatment in your destination, further information can be found on the Government advice pages related to healthcare for UK nationals visiting the EU: <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare</a>. <br /><br />We cannot be held responsible for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or equipment from any accommodation. If this occurs, it is your responsibility to report it first of all to the property management and, if necessary, to the local police, who should provide you with a copy of the police report. Please note that our staff are unable to report such incidents, or obtain copies of police reports, on your behalf.<br /><br /><strong>1.3: ACCURACY OF INFORMATION</strong><br />To the best of our knowledge, the information contained on our website is correct at the time of publication. However, we reserve the right to make changes after publication and will advise you of any changes which we consider significant at the time you book your holiday or when they are finalised. Our website will display the most up-to-date information that we have.<br /><br />Our package holidays and other types of holiday arrangements may also be featured on websites owned and operated by travel agents and other organisations. We have absolutely no control over the content or maintenance of such sites and therefore we cannot accept any liability for information contained on them.<br /><br />The pictures shown in our brochures (where available) and on our websites are included for their style and general relevance and are shown for illustration purposes and unless stated are not necessarily taken at the resort described. Photographs of rooms are intended to give an indication of the typical appearance, but rooms (including in our managed properties) will inevitably vary in size, furnishing and decorative style, particularly where there has been partial renovation.<br /><br />Where distance is quoted in time taken to walk, we have used as a guideline that 100m takes an adult one minute to walk in standard footwear under normal conditions. Clearly, timings will vary according to footwear, age, personal fitness and surface conditions. <br /><br />Early and late season holidays particularly, and potentially other dates (such as where specific events are taking place), may sometimes be affected by the closure/alteration of certain resort facilities. Examples include some ski-lifts and/or ski areas, swimming pools, saunas, ice-rinks, bus or public transport services, shops, bars and/or restaurants, activities advertised either within a particular property or the resort itself. This may be due to maintenance/refurbishment, poor weather conditions, lack of tourists/guests, local authority decisions or if the operators themselves decide to cancel the event or programme or offer a “scaled-down” service at its discretion. As such resort facilities are not owned by Hotelplan Ltd and we have no control over their operation and in many cases are not given notice of their closure, we cannot accept any responsibility should such facilities be withdrawn, curtailed or moved (for example in the case of the location of children’s ski areas) at any time and we may not also be in a position to notify you of such a change. <br /><br />Where free minibus services are advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and/or be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis and could only run at set times, details of which are available in resort. We cannot be held responsible if you miss any, all or part of your other arrangements as a result of the late running or unavailability of these services. <br /><br />Hotelplan Ltd cannot accept responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of industrial action in resort, e.g. strike action by lift operators, bus drivers, etc. Equally, where other factors such as weather impact on the availability of some resort facilities and services, including the operation of lifts, any refunds must be negotiated with the supplier.<br /><br /><strong>1.4: SPECIAL REQUESTS</strong><br />If you have any special requests in respect of, for example, diet, room location or a particular facility at a hotel, you must advise us at the time of booking. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret that we cannot promise that any request will be met unless we have specifically confirmed this in writing, separately and in addition to the Confirmation Invoice. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the request on your Confirmation Invoice or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability. For your own protection, you should obtain confirmation in writing that a special request will be complied with (where it is possible to give this) if it is important to you.<br /><br /><strong>1.5: MEDICAL CONDITIONS (inc. Allergies) / DISABILITIES / REDUCED MOBILITY</strong><br />If you have any special/medical requirements, it is essential that you bring these to our attention at the earliest opportunity and before confirming your holiday, as some accommodation and resorts may be found to be unsuitable. We will endeavour to provide information in our descriptions where, in our opinion based on the information available to us, an accommodation is particularly suitable or unsuitable for persons with specific requirements, though this is of course subjective. It is therefore important that you provide us promptly with written details of your requirements in order that we can help you find a suitable holiday. When booking excursions or events in resort, you should ensure that the excursion or event that you have chosen is suitable and that the provider is made aware of any special requirements that you may have, in order that they may take an informed decision as to the suitability of the excursion or event for you.</p>
<p>A number of the activities included with our holidays require a certain degree of physical fitness. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient levels of fitness for the activities you choose to take part in. If you are in any doubt, you should consult your GP before departure. We and the suppliers of any activities have an absolute right at any time (including after an activity has commenced) to prevent you from undertaking or continuing to participate in any particular activity if we or they reasonably believe that you do not possess the necessary levels of fitness. In such circumstances, no compensation, refunds or expenses will be payable.<br /><br />We are not a specialist disabled holiday company, but we will do our utmost to cater for any special requirements you may have. Our holidays may not be suitable for people with certain disabilities, medical conditions or significantly reduced mobility. Due to the nature of some of the properties that we contract, e.g. those with annexes or chalet accommodation which was not purpose-built as tourist accommodation, some properties may be unsuitable. If you, or any member of your party has any medical problem or disability which may affect your booking, please provide us with full details before you make your booking so that we can try to help you find the package most suitable for your needs. <br /><br />Reduced mobility of course means different things to different individuals as we fully appreciate that individual capabilities, restrictions and requirements are likely to vary considerably. When we refer to reduced mobility, this means any material reduction in mobility whether this is permanent or temporary, and whether caused by age or whether it relates to a physical or mental disability or impairment or other cause of disability. If you suffer from any medical condition, disability, significant reduction in mobility, physical condition or factor (including unusual height or weight), or other health or fitness concerns which may affect your holiday or your participation in any activity, or if you have any special requirements as a result (including any which affect the booking process), please give us full details before you confirm your booking so that we can assist you in considering the suitability of the arrangements and/or making the booking. <br /><br />We may require you to produce a doctor’s certificate certifying that you are fit to participate. In any event, you must give us full details in writing at the time of booking and whenever any material change in your condition, disability, mobility or health occurs. You must also promptly advise us if any medical condition, disability, reduced mobility or other health issue which may affect your holiday develops after your booking has been confirmed. Acting reasonably, if we are unable to properly accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned, taking account of the assistance that can be provided by someone travelling with you, we may be unable to accept your booking or you may not be able to participate in certain activities. If you did not give us full details at the time of booking, we will cancel your booking and impose applicable cancellation charges when we become aware of these details.<br /><br />When booking excursions or events in resort, you should ensure that the excursion or event that you have chosen is suitable and that the provider is made aware of any special requirements that you may have, in order that they may take an informed decision as to the suitability of the excursion or event for you.</p>
<p><strong>1.6: YOUR CONDUCT &amp; BEHAVIOUR</strong><br />We reserve the right to refuse to accept a booking or to cancel, without further liability by us, an existing holiday booking of any prospective guest (and connected party members who are unable or unwilling to retain their bookings when applying any consequential price adjustments), if in our reasonably held opinion or the opinion of any person in authority:<br />i. You behave either during the process of booking or subsequently or on holiday, in an excessively aggressive, antagonistic, abusive or threatening manner towards any member of our staff or the company, our suppliers or other guests; or<br />ii. There has been unacceptable conduct of any kind related to any previous booking with the company; or<br />iii. There is outstanding liability to Hotelplan Ltd, regardless of whether or not the company is on notice of any set-off or counterclaim.<br />The right of cancellation in (ii) and (iii) above shall be exercised with reasonable advance notice where practicable.<br /><br />We want all of our guests to enjoy their holiday with us, but you must remember that you are responsible for your actions and the effect they may have on others. To that end, if an accommodation owner or manager, employee or supplier’s representative or any other person in authority consider it necessary to terminate your holiday arrangements, we will accept no responsibility or liability for making alternative arrangements for accommodation or repatriation nor for covering any costs you may incur. <br /><br />These decisions are of course not taken lightly and will usually be as a direct result of your anti-social behaviour or verbal or physical abuse or bullying of our staff, our suppliers or other guests, or if such behaviour is deemed likely to cause a disturbance to other guests. With that said, we accept no responsibility for any inconvenience or upset caused to you by the actions or behaviour of other guests. This also applies if, in the opinion of any of our resort staff, suppliers or carrier, you appear unfit to travel or you appear likely to cause disturbance or danger to any other passengers. Action will be taken in any such event, which may include terminating an abusive telephone call in the UK or, if the behaviour occurs overseas, calling the police and/or terminating the holiday. <br /><br />No compensation will be payable for the cancellation or early termination of a holiday due to such behaviour, or for cancellation or early termination of the holiday arrangements of connected party members who cannot continue their arrangements without the person affected.<br /><br />In addition to the above and the effect your actions may have on others, you must take responsibility for your own safety and those around you and for maintaining the condition of the accommodation you occupy. To the extent that the law permits, we will not be responsible for any accidents which occur in or around swimming pools or other similar facilities due to your inappropriate or irresponsible behaviour or for any accidents which occur anywhere on properties arising from such behaviour. We appreciate that you may well drink alcohol as part of your enjoyment of your holiday, which you must do responsibly, and to the extent that the law allows we will have no or limited liability for any injury, loss or damage you suffer as a result of your judgment being impaired in full or in part by alcohol.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><br /><strong>2. ACCOMMODATION INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1: STAR RATINGS/COUNTRY STANDARDS</strong><br />Official star ratings, where available, are shown on the property description page on our website. They are primarily intended to give a guide to the range of facilities and services available in each property. As you would expect, 2 and 3 star properties generally have a more limited range of facilities and services than is available in 4 and 5 star properties. In general the overall standard of services and facilities varies significantly from country to country within star categories. For example, an officially rated 4 star property may only possess 3 star standards (and vice versa) despite having an extensive range of services and facilities. This is because of the many different criteria that are used from country to country to assess star ratings.<br />Please note these criteria can differ significantly to those used in the UK by motoring and other organisations and UK ratings cannot therefore be compared to those used overseas. For example, few tourist authorities include an assessment of culinary performance in their ratings.<br />We also show our own rating of each property alongside the property name and above its description. These ratings are based on our own inspections of properties as well as on customer feedback as expressed in our questionnaires. In some cases we may award an additional half ‘spot’ for our own rating where we believe a hotel offers better facilities and services than its official rating would suggest. Conversely we may have downgraded a hotel to give a truer representation of the services and facilities offered.</p>
<p><strong>2.2: NEW-BUILD PROJECTS &amp; REFURBISHMENTS</strong><br />A number of our featured properties are newly built or substantially converted or refurbished each season, and we take every possible care with the owners to ensure that each such property is completed on schedule. Clearly however, matters outside our direct control, such as local authorities or adverse weather at critical times for example, can occasionally cause delays, and/or there may be changes to the designer’s or architect’s plans upon which we have based our description. In the event that either eventuality happens, we will advise you as soon as any impact on your holiday is clear. For more information, please see clause 1.4(a) of our Booking Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>2.3: FREE UPGRADE or ‘ADDED VALUE’ OFFERS</strong><br />Where a hotel offers ‘free’ upgrades on their rooms or other ‘Added Value’ offers, these are subject to availability and may only be applicable to holidays taken in certain months of the season. The hotel may amend or withdraw this offer at any time during the season, without notice.</p>
<p><strong>2.4: CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT</strong> <br />Your room will normally be available from 4pm onwards but please bear with the accommodation if it takes longer. Check-out times may be before 10am or before your departure from resort.<br />Any local charges that may apply are detailed on the accommodation pages and you should make provision for these.</p>
<p>Deposits: Some accommodations request a deposit which must be paid on arrival or place a hold of monies on your card for any incremental costs incurred during your stay. This deposit, or hold, may show on your account as a pending payment, but on check-out and assuming there are no outstanding charges this pending amount will be returned. This may take 3-5 working days, depending on your bank. <br />In the case of damage occurring to your room or outstanding bills such as food or drink, these charges will be deducted from your card or deposit before any balance is returned. Credit cards are sometimes not accepted. <br />If we are contacted by an accommodation provider after you have left with a request for payment of due sums as a result of unpaid bills, fees or other charges, we will pass these on to you and you will be liable for due settlement directly with the supplier.</p>
<p><strong>2.5: BEDROOMS</strong><br />At each of the hotel and apartment properties featured on our website we have an allocation of rooms/apartments at contract rates and conditions. When this allocation is full, it may be possible for us to apply for additional rooms, if we are asked to do so, but these may not always be offered to us at ‘contract’ rates and therefore a supplement may apply. This may also occur if we are asked to obtain rooms of a type/standard not included in our normal allocation. <br />Some partner hotels do offer a choice of smoking and non-smoking rooms. Requests for a preferred type should be made at time of booking but cannot be guaranteed. <br />The size, decor, soundproofing, style and furnishing of bedrooms can differ markedly, even within the same property. There is also considerable variation in floor space, head clearance, clothes storage facilities (sometimes very limited), types of bed and bedding. Some rooms are listed as ‘under eaves’, which can at times limit head clearance by way of low beams and/or the slant of the roof.</p>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Dimensions of rooms in hotels or apartments when quoted are approximate, and normally include the bathroom and the balcony area.</p>
<p><strong>Beds:</strong> In certain locations, particularly in Austria and Switzerland, a twin is commonly accepted as referring to two separate mattresses and duvets contained in one large frame, referred to as an 'Austrian twin' or 'Continental twin'. Twin beds cannot always be separated. Beds may be sofa beds or chair beds, particularly where part of the room is intended as either a sitting area or sleeping area. <br />Apartment prices are based on a minimum occupancy as described on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Beds:</strong> Where an extra bed is added, this may limit the space available and may be smaller than conventional sized single beds. Rooms with extra beds may be bookable for two-person occupancy, although in this case the hotelier may allocate a standard-sized twin bedded room without extra beds. Single rooms do not always match up either in size or facilities to twin bedded rooms, even when a supplement is paid. If you require a cot, we advise that you book a room that can take an extra bed, otherwise the room may feel cramped. Some rooms, particularly those described as small or with restricted head room/under eaves, might not have space for a cot. Hotel charges for cots are set by, and must be paid directly to, the accommodation. Cot linen (not duvets) is usually provided. We cannot guarantee that cots will meet British Safety Standards.</p>
<p><strong>Specific to Canada:</strong> Most rooms have two double beds and, in many cases, hotels allow up to four person occupancy in these rooms. This arrangement may not be suitable for four adults but represents good value for parents who do not mind sharing with their children. Some hotels have rooms of the same category with either one double bed for two persons, or two double beds for two to four persons. Where this is the case, prices are based on four persons sharing a room with two beds and supplements are payable for two persons in a room. The two person occupancy supplement will usually be the same for a room with one double bed as for a room with two double beds.<br /><br /><strong>Specific to Lapland Cabins:</strong> Due to the varying styles of cabin, many will vary in size – including those that are provided within the same category. As a result, the sharing supplement is calculated based on the number of people occupying the cabin, and not by the number of beds available. It should therefore not be confused with a traditional under-occupancy charge (as discussed above). As with most supplements, this charge is non-refundable.<br /><br /><strong>Seating areas:</strong> Seating areas may not typically consist of a full lounge or separate lounge area, but will normally include chair(s), a sofa or other forms of seating.</p>
<p><strong>TV:</strong> Where a TV is advertised, no guarantee is implied as to how many English-speaking channels will be available, if any, including Satellite TV.</p>
<p><strong>Air-conditioning:</strong> even though the property may feature air-conditioning in the rooms, certain countries have strict policies on when the air-conditioning is operational during the season and this is governed by local law. Some hotels may have centrally-controlled air-conditioning, rather than individual units in guest bedrooms, and these are controlled by the hotel management.<br />Some properties include un-advertised facilities such as a TV or kitchenette in the room, which may be disconnected or otherwise out of service. No refund or compensation is payable for the non-availability or non-operation of any property facilities which are not advertised by us and do not form part of your package holiday contract.</p>
<p><strong>Mezzanine levels:</strong> Where mezzanine levels are described, they may be accessible by steep stairs or ladders and will typically be under the eaves in most units or hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Balconies/Terraces &amp; views:</strong> Where a supplement has been paid for a balcony or a terrace, neither a specific view nor aspect is guaranteed. Typically a ‘side’ view will be a view looking out and to the side from your balcony. It should not be assumed that a balcony will include seating or a panoramic view, whether seated or not. In some cases they may be ‘Juliette’ style balconies, with limited floor space. Views from balconies, windows and terraces may be restricted by trees/foliage or other factors beyond our control and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind. The balcony or terrace may be private or shared, and where a ground floor room is allocated, this may be a terrace rather than a balcony.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> In apartments and self-catering apartments, it is generally accepted that a clean at the beginning of the week will occur. Your bedroom will be clean and tidy for your arrival. You will also be required to leave your apartment in a tidy state at the end of your stay and some apartments may provide an end of stay checklist to adhere to. It may also be the case that hotel rooms and all other accommodation are not cleaned on a daily basis. Should you wish to arrange a mid-week clean, or request new towels and bedding, please speak to the accommodation provider who may assist further, but please bear in mind charges may be applied for these services.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Catering:</strong> Some apartments offer self-catering facilities, those these are often limited and include only basic cutlery and utensils. A hob is usually provided, but not an oven. Kettles and toasters aren’t considered essential appliances in Europe so may not be provided. Some properties offer a basic welcome pack including toilet roll and washing up liquid/dishwasher tablets to see you through your first few days. Once these run out, you will need to purchase them locally.</p>
<p><strong>2.6: ANNEXES</strong> <br />When annexes are used, these may be directly owned and controlled by the accommodation provider or contracted in private homes. They may either be joined to the main building or be within walking distance of the accommodation. If you book more than one apartment, whether they are the same type or not, we cannot guarantee that they will be in the same building, though accommodation suppliers will try to accommodate requests where possible.</p>
<p><strong>2.7: LIFTS</strong><br />Please note that in some properties, lifts may not directly service all floors and access to and from these floors may be by stairway only. Not all properties have lifts.</p>
<p><strong>2.8: SECURITY</strong> <br />We cannot be held responsible for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or equipment from any accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>2.9: WI-FI/INTERNET ACCESS</strong> <br />Where Wi-Fi or internet access is indicated in a property description, this belongs to the property and its availability is outside our control. In some more remote resorts signal strength may be limited throughout the whole resort and not just in our properties. No guarantee is given or implied that it will be operative during your holiday; you will not be advised in advance if this facility is removed, and no compensation or refund will be paid if it is not available for whatever reason. Charges may apply. The connections will, in normal circumstances, be suitable for the checking of emails and basic web-browsing, but the downloading and streaming of films and other media may not be possible. <br />Safe-keeping of your laptop computer/tablet/smartphone is your own responsibility, as is ensuring that it is properly insured for the circumstances above; no liability will be accepted for damage to or loss or theft of laptops from accommodation, including if your insurance company refuses to pay out for any reason. We also accept no liability for any loss of data or virus infection to your device whilst on holiday with us, howsoever caused.</p>
<p><strong>2.10: HOTEL LEISURE FACILITIES</strong> <br />General hotel facilities may be open seasonally and their opening times may be subject to change. If a property has a bar on site, its opening hours may vary and you may experience some noise from it, even outside of normal licensing hours. We will also try our best to identify any particularly lively bars within accommodations by referencing this in our website descriptions.</p>
<p>Some hotels, especially in Italy, require you to wear a “bathing” cap whilst using the pool facilities, likewise some hotels adopt a ‘no swimwear’ rule in respect of their sauna areas. Please note, each hotel has its own policy on this rule, which is subject to change without notice. In hotels with spas or wellness centres, massages/beauty treatments will normally be provided by the hotel’s own wellness area staff, but in some cases will be available to book through the hotel with a visiting provider of these services.</p>
<p>Leisure facilities may be subject to limited opening hours, and there may be restrictions on their use by children. Swimming pool, hot-tub, spa-bath and sauna temperatures are determined by the management or owners in accordance with local regulations or guidelines, and may not always match guests’ expectations. Should any leisure facility become unavailable for any reason, we cannot guarantee being able to repair or replace it during your holiday, and do not offer compensation for inconvenience or curtailed use in such an event. <br /><br /><strong>2.11: SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE ACCOMMODATION</strong> <br />Where the accommodation provider offers a service such as childcare or kindergarten facilities, these services are offered and available for use by guests entirely at their own risk. There is no guarantee that the services offered will be equivalent to a UK standard and they may differ from the description of the facility published at the time.</p>
<p><strong>2.12: PETS</strong><br />Some of the properties featured may also be pet-friendly. Whilst we do not routinely offer pet-friendly holidays, private guests or guests booked with other tour operators may have the right to bring their pets to the hotel. Likewise, some accommodations may have resident pets belonging to the staff or owners. If you have a pet allergy, you should discuss this with whoever you book with at the time. <br />If you wish to take a pet on holiday with you, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the appropriate pet passports, vaccinations and insurances in place, where applicable. Some hotels may also levy additional charges to have pets in their properties, payable locally. Please ask our Reservations Team at the time of booking for relevant charges for ferry travel and hotels.</p>
<p><strong>2.13: MEAL ARRANGEMENTS</strong> <br />If you book half board, the first meal you will receive will usually be dinner on the day of your arrival in the resort and the last meal will be breakfast on the morning of your departure from the resort. No drinks are included on a half board option (unless stipulated). Please check the website description of your chosen property for details of the catering arrangements, as some restaurants may not be on site, or details of any nights when catering is not provided.</p>
<p>Clients arriving late at a hotel will normally receive a cold plate. Where this is not available, please reach out to our resort team for support and assistance.</p>
<p>At peak times, some hotels may choose to seat clients together on larger tables. In some places, particularly in Italy, you may be allocated a specific table for meals throughout your stay. This might be shared with another party.</p>
<p>“All Inclusive” hotels include breakfast, a light lunch, evening meals and unlimited drinks in the basic holiday price (although set times and choices may apply at some hotels). Where packed lunches are provided as part of your accommodation stay, they will not be provided on the day of departure.</p>
<p>Some hotels charge for tap water, or may only offer bottled water at an applicable charge.</p>
<p><strong>Meals in Lapland:</strong> Usually comprise a mix of international and traditional Finnish dishes, usually served buffet-style. Festive Dinners in Saariselka with Santa’s Lapland do not follow traditional British Christmas dinner menus, but are buffet-style including a selection of international dishes and local specialities. Please note that the Festive Dinner is not provided in all hotels, so you may be required to walk to another property for the Festive Dinner. If the minimum numbers required for a particular hotel to provide the Festive Dinner are not reached, the Festive Dinner may be provided for you in one of our other hotels a short walk away, joining other Santa’s Lapland guests.</p>
<p> <br /><strong>3. OUR OWN-RUN CHALET &amp; HOTEL ACCOMMODATION</strong> <br />Our own-run Hotels bridge the gap between the traditional chalet holiday and locally-run hotels.

<p>All properties may have Hotelplan Ltd staff and/or members of the property owner’s family living in, and may hold rooms used by Hotelplan staff as a resort office, store room or similar. Please ask for further details if this matter is important to you.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Le Savoie in Val d’Isère:</strong> Slightly different arrangements apply here (e.g. an extended menu choice, flexible dining times and 5-course evening meals, but it is otherwise run on traditional Hotel lines and guest expectations should accordingly be oriented to this more informal style of holiday, operated by our staff. Specifically, please note that certain services you might expect in a ‘French 5 star’ hotel (e.g. room service, à la carte dining, daily towel/linen change, minibars, lunch service, luggage porters etc.) are not provided. <br /><br /><strong>3.2: ACCOMMODATION STANDARDS &amp; RATINGS</strong><br />There is no official rating system for catered chalets and our own-run Hotel accommodation, as many were not built for commercial purposes. We have introduced our own rating as a means of enabling our guests to compare our managed properties with one another. As our menus are of the same standard across our managed properties, we do not consider catering when assessing our ratings. Our own-run Hotels are not the same as ‘Hotels’, and are run as larger scale chalets staffed by employees who are carefully selected and who receive comprehensive training from us, but who are not necessarily trained hospitality professionals.<br /><br />Accommodation will comply with any appropriate local standards of the country in which the property is situated, which may differ from UK standards. Within chalets and our own-run Hotels, rooms and facilities can vary greatly, and we often find that a degree of tolerance is needed when it comes to Alpine standards of plumbing, electrics and hot water supplies. <br /><br />Our prices reflect the standard of the accommodation you choose, but can also be influenced by location in resort, staffing ratios, transfer costs and, in particular, regional differences in rentals.</p>
<p>Our staff are trained to take reasonable precautions in making our own-run chalets and hotels reasonably safe for children but it must be noted that our properties were not designed with children in mind. It is not possible for us to childproof our chalets and hotels and you will therefore need to be more vigilant than in your own home. <br /><br /><strong>3.3: OCCUPANCY</strong><br />When two figures are given for the capacity of a chalet, the lower one is the normal occupancy figure, based on regular beds including sofa-beds in some cases. The higher figure allows for increased occupancy, using put-u-up beds. Neither figure includes infants occupying cots. Put-u-ups and sofa-beds may limit the space available and cause inconvenience, so please do ask our Reservations team for advice if bedroom space is important to you. Where bunk beds are present in accommodation, they may not be comparable to standard full-size single beds.<br /><br /><strong>3.4: UNDER-OCCUPANCY</strong> <br />Single rooms and rooms for sole occupancy usually book up fast and are limited. If you book a room for single occupancy that normally accommodates more than one person, i.e. a twin or double room, or you book a room offering more beds than your party size, we ask you to contribute towards our loss if by paying an under-occupancy supplement. The supplement per empty bed payable is 75% of the basic adult air-inclusive price for the first empty bed space, and 100% for each empty bed space thereafter. We reserve the right to limit the number of beds left unoccupied and the number that we are able to offer at a 75% discount. The empty bed charge in the Hotel Le Savoie is 100% of the basic adult air-inclusive price in all cases. Infants occupying cots do not count towards occupancy figures.<br /><br /><strong>3.5: EXCLUSIVE USE</strong> <br />The entirety of our own-run chalets and Hotels can be booked for exclusive use for your group or family. This means that no other guests will be in residence, however Inghams and/or members of the chalet/Hotel owner’s family may occupy parts of the building. (See also 3.21). Please ask for written details if this matter is important to you. If you cannot fill all the advertised minimum-occupancy beds, a supplement is payable that replaces the total room under-occupancy supplements. If separate bookings are sharing a chalet or own-run Hotel, we are not able to disclose any details appertaining to other guests. Party leaders are responsible for their groups. <br /><br /><strong>3.6: COMMUNAL AREAS</strong> <br />We endeavour to include floor plans and floor-by-floor descriptions on our website. This includes an indication of the communal areas available to our guests. Seating in these areas may not typically consist of a full lounge or separate lounge area, but will normally include chair(s), a sofa or other forms of seating. Please be aware though that there may not be sufficient soft seating for every guest. <br /><br /><strong>3.7: SECURITY</strong> <br />Our properties do not have safes for securing guests’ valuables and it is unusual for chalets to be locked during the day or overnight, or for there to be locks on bedroom doors. Our own-run Hotels normally have a night porter on duty. In many cases we offer keys, key cards or combination locks for which a deposit may be payable, but this cannot be guaranteed. In some chalets, parts of the building may be shared by other residents using the same communal entrance. Although we do not specify these points in each chalet description, if it is of concern please ask our Reservations staff for details. We cannot accept liability for the damage to, loss or theft of personal belongings or ski equipment from any accommodation.<br /><br /><strong>3.8: CHECK-IN</strong> <br />Your room will normally be available from 4pm onwards but please bear with us if it takes a little longer. If you are leaving resort after 10am, we would ask that you please vacate your bedrooms before this time so that they can be made ready for arriving guests. <br /><br />In common with standard hotel industry practice, we reserve the right to take credit card imprints upon check-in at our own-run Hotels and certain chalets to cover potential damage costs or breakages.<br /><br />We reserve the right to apply a damage deposit of up to £1,000 per booking either in the UK prior to departure or on arrival in resort. This is payable either by debit or credit card. We appreciate that normal usage causes wear upon furniture, fixtures and fittings and this is always taken into consideration, but actual damage caused by guests, either by accident or negligence, must be paid for by the person who caused it, or by the party leader of the group, or will be retained from the damage deposit (where taken).<br /><br /><strong>3.9: PORTERAGE</strong> <br />Porterage is not included in the cost of the holiday. If you allow our staff or coach drivers to assist with the transfer of your luggage from or to the main coach and/or feeder vehicles, you do so entirely at your own risk as we do not accept responsibility for your luggage at any time and you remain responsible at all times for ensuring your luggage is on the appropriate vehicle.<br /><br /><strong>3.10: BEDROOMS</strong><br />The size, decor, soundproofing and furnishing of bedrooms can differ markedly, even within the same property. There is also considerable variation in floor space, head clearance, clothes storage facilities (sometimes very limited), types of bed and bedding. In some chalets, bedrooms lead from communal rooms. Some rooms are listed as ‘under eaves’, which can at times limit head clearance by way of low beams and/or the slant of the roof. <br /><br />We make every effort to describe bedrooms as accurately as possible and to this end we use the term SUITE (where there are distinctly separate sleeping areas, e.g. a bedroom and separate living-room with sofa-bed) and ROOM (where all beds are in one area). We recommend that you stress special room requirements at the time of booking. Some bedrooms and suites have kitchenettes reflecting their occasional use for self-catering. They are not equipped for use and for safety reasons we disconnect most of the electrical and gas equipment. <br /><br />Beds may be sofa-beds or chair-beds, particularly in family accommodation where part of the room is intended as either a sleeping area or a sitting area. Chalets and our own-run Hotels may provide an ‘Austrian twin’ or ‘Continental twin’ (i.e. a double bed frame with two single mattresses and two single duvets) in rooms described as doubles or twins. Twin beds may not always be able to be separated.<br /><br />When bedrooms are described as having ‘private’ facilities which are not en suite, this means the facilities are not shared with other guests, though your Chalet Host may occasionally need to use the wc and hand-washing facilities.<br /><br /><strong>En Suite Facilities:</strong> These will always include a bath or mini-bath or shower, but do not necessarily include toilets - please see the individual property’s ‘Accommodation Summary’ for details of each room’s precise facilities. Bathrooms may not always have full size baths and showers may not always have a shower tray or curtain.<br /><br /><strong>Balconies and Views:</strong> Where a supplement has been paid for a balcony, neither a specific view nor aspect is guaranteed, and the balcony may be private or shared. It should not be assumed that a balcony will include seating. Views from balconies and windows may be restricted by trees/foliage or other factors beyond our control and no express or implied representation is made regarding there being a ‘view’ of any kind from a window or balcony, unless expressly described.</p>
<p>Stairs, ladders and bunks: Some of our properties contain beds on mezzanine platforms that are accessible by steep stairs or ladders. We do not recommend that children under 8 years old use them. Where children use bunk beds, we recommend 6 years old as the minimum age for occupying the high-level bed, which may not have a guardrail.</p>
<p><strong>Stair-gates:</strong> We do not provide stair gates in any of our properties. If you choose to bring a stair-gate with you, or hire one locally, it is your responsibility to ensure its proper installation and operation at all times, including by other adult and child guests in the property.<br /><br /><strong>3.11: CATERING</strong><br />Breakfast is run on a self-service basis, normally between 8 and 9am. There is of course unlimited tea and coffee. The milk supplied is likely to be UHT. With a full quota of guests present, breakfast can get busy so a degree of patience may be needed and our staff may ask that guests stagger their arrival times for breakfast, to facilitate smoother service. <br /><br />For afternoon tea our staff provide a cake (and savoury treats in our own-run Hotels) daily, except on their day off, and guests should help themselves to tea and coffee. <br /><br />Evening meals are provided for 6 nights on a 7 night holiday, and 12 nights on a 14 night holiday, and are served around 8pm. Please see the information above for each accommodation type and the catering offered, and also the individual property descriptions for details. In our own-run Hotels, where offered, you can book your preferred family dining time with Reception. <br /><br />We do not permit non-guests of our chalets and our own-run Hotels to dine in our properties, except under exceptional circumstances and only if agreed in writing at time of booking. <br /><br />The consumption of duty-free and locally purchased alcohol is prohibited in the public areas of our own-run Hotels, in accordance with local licensing laws.<br /><br />In all properties on the first evening, due to differing arrival times, the evening meal will be served at the convenience of the majority. For those on early departing transfers to the airport, only the Continental breakfast may be provided.<br /><br />Guests are not permitted to use the kitchens in our own-run chalets and Hotels, except where a ‘cook your own supper’ option is available in chalets. Further information will be provided by our resort staff.</p>
<p>Kitchens of chalets and our own-run Hotels are not to be used to prepare daily lunches and/or an evening meal on the staff night off. This includes using any of the electrical appliances such as microwaves, cookers and dishwashers, although this list is not exhaustive. Bottle warmers for infants can be provided on request locally.<br /><br /><strong>Special Diets &amp; Food Allergies:</strong> If you have a serious allergy which requires a special diet to be prepared separately from other guests’ food, your booking cannot be confirmed until we have been able to confirm we can supply such a diet, even if you receive a booking confirmation invoice in the interim (see extreme food allergies below).<br /><br />Please note that our liability in respect of Special Diets &amp; Food Allergies applies only to our own-run chalets Hotels where we provide the catering, and you are advised to check with your airline as to what procedures they have in place in this regard.<br /><br />Vegetarian meals are offered as part of the menu choice in our own-run Hotels. In chalets we do need 14 days’ notice in writing of a request for vegetarian or vegan meals and for these to be pre-booked. <br /><br />Other special diets (e.g. gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, low-fat/cholesterol, vegan, specific food allergies etc.) can normally be provided, but must be discussed with our Reservations team before booking. All such dietary requests and/or food allergies must be confirmed to us in writing at least 14 days prior to departure. We unfortunately are unable to accept special dietary requests within 4 days prior to departure and will be unable to confirm that we can cater for your needs. <br /><br /><strong>Food Allergy Policy:</strong> We have a well-developed Food Allergy Policy in place, with a view to avoiding any allergic reaction incidents, and shall exercise reasonable care to avoid specified food and drink ingredients if special diets are agreed at the time of booking and confirmed in writing as above. However, in choosing to travel with us, you accept the following facts:- that staff in our own-run chalets and Hotels involved in catering are generally not qualified catering professionals; that no food allergy system can ever provide a 100% guarantee against any contact with a specified foodstuff; that items such as eggs, dairy products and nuts are constantly present in chalet kitchens and dining areas, so cross-contamination cannot be ruled out; that our staff cannot police what snacks third parties may bring into contact with the allergic person; that staff may not be aware of precise food contents (where they do not speak the language in which the ingredients are labelled, for example); that our staff cannot police lunches provided by ski-schools. We therefore cannot and do not guarantee the avoidance of specified ingredients, and cannot accept liability in the event of any dissatisfaction with special dietary arrangements, including the occurrence of an allergic reaction.<br /><br /><strong>Extreme Food Allergies:</strong> where a food allergy is so severe that the slightest exposure to the substance in question could cause a life-threatening reaction, you must advise us in writing of the severe nature of the allergy at the time of booking. We then reserve the right to advise you that, in our considered view, the controls we are able to implement in the ski chalet environment are insufficient to guarantee your, or your child’s safety, in which case, should you choose to proceed with the booking, you do so entirely at your own risk, and would be asked to confirm this in writing in order to confirm the booking. If you fail to advise us of a known extreme allergy at the point of booking, you will be in breach of contract, and we will therefore have no liability to you at all in the event of any incident.<br /><br /><strong>3.12: STAFF</strong> <br />Our chalets and own-run Hotels may have Inghams staff and/or members of the chalet owner’s family or employees living in, and may be used by staff as a resort office, storeroom or similar. Please ask for written details if this matter is important to you.<br /><br />If you are booking one of our own-run chalet Hotels, you acknowledge and accept that booking this style of holiday is not the same as booking ‘a hotel’. Specifically, you accept that the staff are largely young, seasonal workers from all walks of life, and not hospitality professionals, and you undertake to travel with realistic expectations and a degree of tolerance for minor issues which might occasionally fall short of perfection. <br /><br />In order to comply with local labour laws our chalet and own-run Hotel staff have one day’s rest each week and will otherwise work on a rota basis. On their days off, our staff will leave out a simple continental breakfast and are then off work until the following day. During this time, no other catering is provided. In the evening you have the opportunity to sample dinner in one of the village restaurants or, where applicable, select our ‘cook your own supper’ option. <br /><br /><strong>3.13: SEASON START-UP</strong><br />We work hard to train all our staff pre-season to the standard required to deliver the services outlined in our brochure and on our website, but our holiday prices are kept low for the first week of the season, reflecting the need for a degree of tolerance from our guests for the fact that staff are settling in to new roles.<br /><br /><strong>3.14: CLEANING &amp; HYGIENE</strong> <br />Your bedroom will normally be clean and tidy for your arrival (subject to guests’ departure/arrival times) and en suite bathrooms will be cleaned once, mid-week, during your stay. Otherwise its state is left to you. The staff in our own-run chalets and Hotels will normally empty your accessible waste bins each day and clean all communal rooms (except on their day off). We are particularly conscious of the need for catering hygiene and during their pre-season training course, all our catering staff will have been trained to the City &amp; Guilds Level 2 in Food Safety. Our managers also carry out spot checks and full hygiene inspections regularly. If you are unhappy with any aspect of chalet hygiene or cleaning, please raise the matter immediately in resort so that appropriate action can be taken. Our reservations staff can give details of laundry facilities in resorts as our own-run chalets and Hotels do not have facilities for guests to use.<br /><br /><strong>3.15: SLIPPER ZONES</strong> <br />We ask guests not to wear outdoor shoes or boots inside our own-run chalets and Hotels for reasons of hygiene and to protect the furnishings and fittings, so please ensure that you take slippers or indoor shoes with you.<br /><br /><strong>3.16: TELEPHONES &amp; WI-FI</strong><br />Our properties do not have telephones. If a telephone facility is important to you we recommend you take a mobile phone. <br /><br />We have Wi-Fi installed and available in the public areas of all our own-run chalets and Hotels, but signal strength is likely to vary by property, depending on location. However, in the event that technical or other issues prevent this, no refund or compensation will be paid and there is no guarantee that Wi-Fi is typically available in bedrooms. The connections will, in normal circumstances, be suitable for the checking of emails and basic web-browsing, but the downloading and streaming of films and other media will not be possible. <br /><br />We also request that you limit usage to one device per person, to avoid over-loading the system and thereby restricting its availability to other guests. Safe-keeping of your laptop computer/tablet/smartphone is your own responsibility, as is ensuring that it is properly insured for the circumstances above; no liability will be accepted for damage to or loss or theft of laptops from accommodation, including if your insurance company refuses to pay out for any reason. We also accept no liability for any loss of data or virus infection to your device whilst on holiday with us, however caused. In some mountain resorts, signal strength is limited throughout the resort not just in our properties. <br /><br /><strong>3.17: TVs / DVDs</strong><br />Some of the larger chalets have TVs and DVD-players which guests may use to play their own DVDs. Unfortunately, if TVs or DVD players become unserviceable, we cannot always get immediate replacements as the UK systems are not compatible with local versions and we may have to obtain spares from the UK. Where a TV is advertised, no guarantee is implied as to how many English-speaking channels will be available, if any, whilst some are advertised as “TV/DVD” which implies that no channels (satellite or otherwise) are available and that the TV is to be used for playing DVDs only.<br /><br /><strong>3.18: SMOKING</strong><br />We operate a strict no-smoking policy in all our own-run chalets and Hotels, which includes the use of E-Cigarettes. A guest who breaches this policy will be liable to pay a fine of €100 / CHF150 to pay for additional deep-cleaning required, and will be held liable for all other consequential damages sought against Hotelplan Ltd by its other guests and/or the property owners.<br /><br /><strong>3.19: PETS</strong><br />Notwithstanding changes to UK legislation, we do not permit pets in our properties.<br /><br /><strong>3.20: NEW-BUILD PROJECTS &amp; REFURBISHMENTS</strong> <br />A number of our own-run chalets and Hotels are newly built or substantially converted or refurbished for us each season, and we take every possible care with the owners to ensure that each such property is completed on schedule. Clearly however, matters outside our direct control, such as local authorities or adverse weather at critical times for example, can occasionally cause delays, and/or there may be changes to the designer’s or architect’s plans upon which we have based our description. In the event that either eventuality happens, we will advise you as soon as any impact on your holiday is clear in accordance with clause 1.4(a) of the Booking Conditions. <br /><br /><strong>3.21: FACILITIES</strong> <br />In our managed properties, facilities such as a lift, log fire, pool, sauna, steam-room, hot-tub, TV/DVD player, Wi-Fi, or other leisure facilities contracted through us as part of your package holiday arrangement may become unavailable during the season. If these are important to your package holiday enjoyment, please make this known to us at the time of booking and confirm to us in writing. If we are informed that there have been any changes to such facilities, and you have alerted us, in writing, to the fact that they are important to your booking, we shall do our best to advise you but we shall not be obliged in such circumstances either to provide the facility or to compensate for its absence. <br /><br />We do not normally provide separate towels for leisure facilities, so we suggest you bring your own towels for use of such leisure facilities. Leisure facilities may be subject to limited opening hours, i.e. 4pm-7pm and are normally out of use for at least one day per week while they are cleaned.<br /><br />Swimming-pool, hot-tub, spa-bath and sauna temperatures are determined by the owners in accordance with local regulations or guidelines, and may not always match guests’ expectations. We do not recommend that children or those suffering with heart conditions use hot-tubs, saunas or steam rooms. Please note that there are no Lifeguards on duty and we cannot guarantee staff will be available in or around the pool or hot-tub area at all times. Please note that you use all such leisure facilities at your own risk, and are responsible in particular for your children’s safety in leisure facilities at all times.<br /><br />Should any leisure facility become unavailable for any reason, we cannot guarantee being able to repair or replace it during your holiday, and do not offer compensation for inconvenience or curtailed use in such an event.</p>
<p>In the event that you make private arrangements for resort child care of any kind, whether or not undertaken by our off duty staff, Hotelplan does not accept liability for any loss directly or indirectly connected with such arrangements, however caused. For insurance reasons, private nannies are not permitted in our chalets or hotels unless booked as a resident member of your party.<br /> <br /><strong>4. TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS</strong><br />E-Borders: It is a requirement of your booking that all passengers provide certain information which is then shared with government authorities and border control and security agencies for the purpose of security and counter-terrorism. This is generally known as Advance Passenger Information (API). The information that you will be required to provide will include, but is not limited to: your full name as per your passport, gender, date of birth, travel document type, travel document number, start date and expiry dates, and the country of issue. <br /><br />Contact Information: When completing your Advanced Passenger Information (API), we will ask you for a mobile telephone number that we may use in the event of delays to our travel arrangements, so that we may keep you as informed as possible. If you wish to be kept up-to-date with such information, please provide us with a mobile telephone number that will be switched on at such times. You may incur a charge from your service provider. Your mobile number will not be used for marketing purposes. If you have booked through a Travel Agent and they enter their own telephone contact details, in doing so they assume responsibility to act as a conduit of any information received via our Text Message service and pass any such information on to you.<br /><br /><strong>ATOL &amp; Carrier Information:</strong> All flight arrangements are made under our own Air Travel Organiser’s Licence number 0025. When you travel by air, land or on water, the relevant carrier’s Conditions of Carriage will apply to your journey, some of which may limit liability, as set out under ‘Our Liability to you’. We are required to advise you of the actual carrier(s) (or if the carrier(s) is not known, the likely carrier(s) that will operate your flight(s) at the time of booking. Where we are only able to inform you of the likely carrier(s) at the time of booking, we shall inform you of the identity of the actual carrier(s) as soon as we become aware of this. Any change to the operating carrier(s) after your booking has been confirmed will be notified to you as soon as possible. <br /><br /><strong>Timings:</strong> We are not always in a position to confirm the flight timings which will be used in connection with your flight. All land and air travel arrangements, airlines, aircraft types, timings, routings and arrival airports are provisional until confirmed with our e-tickets and may change after this due to circumstances beyond our control. The flight timings shown on our website and/or detailed on your Booking Confirmation and Invoice are for guidance only and are subject to alteration and confirmation. Flight timings are outside our control. They are set by airlines and are subject to various factors including airport operating slots and restrictions, traffic control restrictions, weather conditions, potential technical problems and the ability of passengers to check in on time.<br /><br />Specific instructions relating to departure and travel arrangements will be provided approximately 2 weeks before departure. You must check this information very carefully immediately upon receipt to ensure you have the correct flight times and other up to date travel information. It is possible that this information may change. Any change in the identity of the carrier, flight timings and/or aircraft type (if advised) will not entitle you to cancel or change to other arrangements without paying our normal charges except where specified in these conditions. Our website is our responsibility, as your tour operator. It is not issued on behalf of, and does not commit the airlines mentioned herein, or any airline whose services are used in the course of your travel arrangements.</p>
<p>Delays, Diversions &amp; Re-scheduling: Operational decisions may be taken by carriers and/or airports and other such authorities, resulting in delays, diversions or re-scheduling. As this is not within our control, we cannot accept liability for such situations. In a force majeure situation, such as severe weather conditions or industrial disputes, we reserve the right to substitute airlines/aircraft and make any necessary alteration to your travel arrangements, including a change of airport and method of carriage, to enable us to fulfil our package holiday promise to transport you to and from the resort or your UK departure airport.</p>
<p>We are also obliged to bring to your attention the existence of a “community list” of airlines that are banned from operating within the EU. To view it go to <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.europa.eu" target="_blank">www.europa.eu</a> and search on banned airlines. <br /><br /><strong>4.1: FLIGHTS</strong><br />In the majority of cases, seat allocations are handled by the airline, not us, and seats together cannot be guaranteed in all cases, particularly if you arrive later for check-in, although check-in staff and cabin crew will do their best. Clearly, when a flight is full for example, it may be physically impossible to seat every single passenger as they would wish. Some airlines allow passengers to pre-book seating and in-flight meals on certain routes, which must be done directly by you with the airline upon payment of a fee. In the event of any issue with the provision of any seating or in-flight meals booked and paid for with the airline directly, this will need to be taken up with the airline themselves.<br /><br />Most of our flights operate on a ‘Buy-on-Board’ basis for snacks and drinks, but we cannot guarantee that this service will always be available or that the airline will cater for special dietary requirements. Aircraft capacity for on-board catering is limited and items can run out. We always recommend purchasing snacks and drinks inside the airport (after security or ‘airside’), particularly if travelling with children.<br /><br />Pregnant women are usually eligible to fly up to the 28th week of pregnancy on the date of return travel, but as this may vary, please check with both your doctor and the relevant airline. Children under 2 years of age on the return date of travel must sit on a parent’s lap and are not entitled to a luggage allowance or catering. Civil Aviation Authority regulations dictate that a child of 2 years or older on date of return travel must have its own air seat, and will otherwise be denied boarding by the airline. Such a child must be booked and priced accordingly for the entirety of the holiday.<br /><br /><strong>4.2: FLIGHT CHANGES, DELAYS &amp; DIVERSIONS</strong> <br />Delays to flights do sometimes occur. At such times we work closely with our airline partners and overseas offices to try to make any delay as short as possible, and to reorganise transfers accordingly where we can. When a delay occurs we will try to make sure refreshments are made available where appropriate. Such arrangements will normally be the responsibility of the airline concerned, in accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, though where this is not done, the passenger/s should claim for reasonable expenses from the airline. Our recommended travel insurance policy provides some cover in the event of delay at your outward or homeward point of departure. If you or any member of your party misses your flight or other transport arrangement, it is cancelled or you are subject to a delay of over 3 hours for any reason, you must contact us and the airline or other transport operator concerned immediately.<br /><br />Under EU Law, you have rights in some circumstances to refunds and/or compensation from the airline in cases of denied boarding, cancellation or delay to flights. Full details of these rights will be publicised at EU airports and will also be available from airlines. If your airline does not comply with these rules, you may use the CAA Passenger Advice and Complaints Service. See <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.caa.co.uk/passengers/resolving-travel-problems" target="_blank">www.caa.co.uk/passengers/resolving-travel-problems</a> for further details.<br /><br />Reimbursement in such cases is the responsibility of the airline and will not automatically entitle you to a refund of your holiday price from us. If, for any reason, you do not claim against the airline and make a claim for compensation from us, you must, at the time of payment of any compensation to you, make a complete assignment to us of the rights you have against the airline in relation to the claim that gives rise to that compensation payment. A delay or cancellation to your flight does not automatically entitle you to cancel any other arrangements even where those arrangements have been made in conjunction with your flight.<br /><br />We cannot accept liability for any delay which is due to any of the reasons set out in clause 1.6 of our Booking Conditions (which includes the behaviour of any passenger(s) on any flight).<br /><br />We cannot offer compensation for inconvenience or loss of holiday time caused by flight delays, flight diversions, road/weather conditions or curtailment regardless of how caused. Similarly it is not possible to obtain refunds for any unused accommodation or facilities or for losses, costs and expenses of other travel/accommodation arrangements outside of the package holiday resulting from flight changes, delays or diversions, which should be claimed on your own insurance policy. <br /><br />Very rarely we may be forced by, for example, adverse weather conditions or road closures (not necessarily in your chosen resort) to make alternative arrangements and in the interests of safety for your outward and/or return journey (generally at the point of flight departure and dependent upon availability of local facilities) the cost of which, if not covered by the airline, must be claimed on your own travel insurance. In such circumstances we will endeavour to provide reasonable assistance with alternative arrangements, but you will not be entitled to additional compensation.<br /><br />If you are using connecting or internal flights either outbound or homebound to connect with our flights and experience a delay, we ask that you telephone us to inform us of your amended travel arrangements. Relevant contact details can be found in the Contact Us section on our website. Please note that we do not accept responsibility in the event of any delay to, or if you miss, connecting flights or other services that have not been booked through us. If you are booking connecting flights we would recommend that you purchase a ticket which may allow a degree of flexibility in the event of any delay or change to your advertised flight timings. <br /><br />If your flight is delayed resulting in late arrival in resort (i.e. after 9pm) you will usually be offered a cold plate or a reduced menu on arrival. <br /><br />On your return journey to the UK our obligation, particularly in a force majeure situation, is to provide transportation back to your original UK departure airport. To do this we reserve the right to substitute airlines/aircraft and make any necessary alteration to your travel arrangements, including a change of method of carriage. Return flights may be arranged to an alternative airport in the UK with onward surface transportation to your original airport. <br /><br />Where it is impossible for you to return to your departure point as per the agreed return date of your package, due to “unavoidable or extraordinary circumstances”, we shall provide you with any necessary accommodation (where possible, of a comparable standard) for a period not exceeding 3 nights per person. Please note that the 3 night cap does not apply to persons with reduced mobility, pregnant women or unaccompanied minors, nor to persons needing specific medical assistance, provided we have been notified of these particular needs in advance. For the purposes of this clause, “unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances” mean warfare, acts of terrorism, significant risks to human health such as the outbreak of a serious disease at the travel destination or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or weather conditions which make it impossible to travel safely back to your departure point.<br /><br />We will not accept responsibility for alternative travel arrangements you choose to make yourself and in no circumstances will we accept responsibility for loss of earnings or professional fees.<br /><br /><strong>4.3: BAGGAGE &amp; BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE</strong><br />The baggage allowance for our flights is advised with your e-tickets (normally 20-23kgs per person, excluding infants) and must not be exceeded in any circumstances, or check-in staff may levy excess baggage charges or be unable to place your luggage on the flight. Baggage allowance on scheduled flights is limited to one piece of hold baggage per person (excluding infants) and weight restrictions should be checked with us at the time of booking, as they may differ from those published by the airlines themselves. If you are travelling on a low cost airline (e.g. EasyJet) we will automatically reserve the carriage of one piece of baggage for you. <br /><br /><strong>4.4: PERSONAL BELONGINGS</strong><br />All your belongings remain your responsibility at all times and Hotelplan Ltd will not be held responsible for any items being mislaid, loaded onto wrong coaches, left behind etc. It is normally your responsibility to manage your baggage at all times including its transfer on and off transfer vehicles and to and from the hotel or property you are residing in. No liability is accepted for misplacement of items, leaving items/luggage behind or mistaking someone else’s luggage for your own or another guest/person taking your luggage off any transfer, believing it to be their own or otherwise. Hotelplan Ltd accepts no responsibility for luggage lost or damaged by the airline or airport baggage handlers or coach drivers, and if this occurs, you should notify the service provider immediately of any problem that has arisen. You should contact the airline, airport or coach company directly and use your travel insurance for any resulting claim. Baggage allowance may change if your carrier changes.<br /><br /><strong>4.5: CARRIAGE OF SKIS/SNOWBOARDS &amp; SPORTING EQUIPMENT</strong><br />Skis/Snowboards: If you have your own equipment, then please do let us know when booking your holiday so that we can do our best to ensure that your skis or snowboard can be carried on your flight, as ski carriage can be limited. Ski boots and snowboard boots are carried as part of your normal luggage allowance. It is also helpful for us to be informed of any additional baggage, such as skis/snowboards, for our onward transfer arrangements.<br /><br />Pre-booked skis/snowboard carriage on our charter flights is normally £40 return per snowboard or pair of skis, with the exception of EasyJet who can charge £70 to pre-book, and this can sometimes be up to £70 each way on scheduled flights to Europe (current price to be advised at time of booking). On long-haul flights, for example to Canada, the charge can be in excess of £70 each way, so please do clarify this at the time of booking. Please be aware that this is per set of equipment and that ski/snowboard bags presented for carriage containing more than one pair of skis/snowboard where the appropriate charge per set of equipment has not been pre-paid will be charged for at check-in. Carriage of skis/snowboards presented for check-in at the airport without being shown as pre-booked on your confirmation invoice cannot be guaranteed and, if carried, will carry a charge payable at the airport in cash prior to check-in which can be considerably higher than the pre-booked price.<br /><br />Some aircraft have limited capacity for skis/snowboards, and space is allocated on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. These flights do not operate a ‘pay at the airport’ alternative. No liability is accepted by Hotelplan Ltd if you do not pre-book carriage and the airline is unable to carry your equipment. There is no liability taken for airlines that may not offer to carry snowboards within their ski carriage policies.<br /><br />If you are travelling on a scheduled flight and wish to take your own skis please enquire at the time of booking as ski carriage rules and charges vary by airline. Charges quoted are usually ‘per sector’ (i.e. a charge applies for the outbound and homebound journey). You may wish to consider pre-booking ski hire in resort instead.</p>
<p><strong>Bicycles &amp; Other Equipment:</strong> Please enquire at time of booking as charges will usually apply.</p>
<p><strong>4.6: TRANSFERS</strong><br />Where transfer times are given on our resort pages, these are approximate and do not include refreshment/toilet stops or delays dropping guests at other properties. The times may also be affected by weather, road and traffic conditions. In particular, congestion during continental school holidays can cause delays, as may road closures due to roadworks, avalanche risks, etc.<br /><br />We ask for your understanding accordingly if, faced with forecasts of heavy snow/inclement weather and/or heavy holiday traffic, we need to arrange your homeward transfer earlier than normal to allow extra time to reach the airport.</p>
<p>In order to keep prices low and still offer a range of UK departure airports, we often combine our coach transfers to and from resort with guests travelling on different flights. As such, it may be necessary to wait for guests arriving on other flights, but we try to keep waiting time to a minimum. On occasion we may transfer you by coach to a central point and provide a smaller vehicle to transfer you the remainder of the way to your resort. Some of our twin centre holidays involve a transfer via the airport. Please ask our Reservations Team if this is important to you.</p>
<p>Transfers can be by coach, shared mini-bus, train or car. Private transfers are required in some resorts as standard, but in others they can usually be arranged at a supplement – please speak to our Reservations Team for further information. If you’re planning on travelling with a non-collapsible wheelchair or electric mobility device, please let us know at the time of booking so that we can book an appropriate transfer for you. Availability can be limited and there may be an additional cost.</p>
<p>On arrival at your overseas airport, our coaches will be parked in the coach park as near as possible to the terminal buildings, though this can sometimes be a short walk away. While we do have Representatives at the airport, they are not able to assist guests with their luggage so please do bear this in mind.</p>
<p>“Short transfers” indicates a resort with driving times to/from the airport of 90 minutes or less in normal, undisrupted weather and traffic conditions. Transfers are not always accompanied by a Representative, though you will usually be met at your arrival airport. The transfer into resort may not stop directly outside your property and at times, a feeder may be provided (if applicable). If you require assistance to the door of your accommodation, please let our Reservations team know at time of booking.</p>
<p>Although many coaches are equipped with toilets, they are not always available for use, for a variety of reasons. European coaches do not always have fitted seatbelts, though where seatbelts are available we urge you to use them. Infants under the age of 2 years on the return date of travel must sit on a parent’s lap, whereas passengers 2 years and older are allocated their own seat on flights and transfers. If you wish to bring a car seat, or have an infant in a rear-facing car seat, please speak with our Reservations team as you may need to book and pay for a private transfer.</p>
<p>Some properties are not situated close to coach-accessible roads and walks from 50 to 400 metres, sometimes with gradients, are necessary on arrival and departure. Please see the property description and, if this is important to you, call our Reservations team. Transfers will endeavour to drop you off directly outside your accommodation wherever possible, but there may be times where, due to adverse weather conditions or other circumstances beyond our control, this may not be possible. We will not accept liability for this and no compensation will be offered where you are required to walk some distance to your accommodation.</p>
<p>In the event of a flight diversion to an outbound flight for whatever reason, we will endeavour to arrange coaches and staff to be at the alternative airport to meet you, but this cannot be guaranteed at short notice and we ask for your patience and understanding. No liability will be accepted if a diversion causes a delay at the arrival airport and/or a longer than advertised transfer to resort. Restrictions on drivers’ working hours can occasionally affect coach availability and may result in delays.</p>
<p><strong>4.7: INDEPENDENT TRAVEL</strong> <br />Please note that you should plan to arrive at your accommodation after 4pm on arrival day and to leave by 10am on your departure day. Very few properties have parking spaces for self-drive guests and others have extremely limited spaces or no space at all, so please check with our Reservations team before you travel. Public parking in resort is always subject to availability and will normally incur a charge which you pay locally. If arranging your own flights, it will not be possible to join our coach transfers, and you should be aware that it can be extremely expensive to arrange transfers by taxi from your arrival airport to the resort. There will not normally be any price reduction in the event that you choose not to use our flights.</p>
<p><strong>Driving abroad:</strong> <br />If you are self-driving to resort and taking your own car, your UK driving licence will be recognised. Even if you have a GB and Euro symbol on your number plate, you must make sure that you display a “GB” sticker on your vehicle. If you are hiring a car, ensure you have a green card. In both cases you must make sure that you have the relevant international driving insurance with your chosen provider.<br /><br />We recommend that you check the Government website for the most up-to-date information: <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit</a></p>
<p><strong>4.8: SWISS FLY LUGGAGE</strong><br />In the event of any delay, loss or damage to your luggage when taking advantage of the Swiss Fly Luggage system, any and all complaints and claims must be lodged with the supplier directly. Details can be found here: Help with luggage and luggage registration | SBB help &amp; contact <br /><strong> </strong><br /><strong>5. ADDED ON EXTRAS</strong><br /><br /><strong>5.1: YOUR CONTRACT</strong><br />We may provide you with information (on our website and/or when you are on holiday) about activities and excursions which are available in the area you are visiting. We have no involvement in any such activities or excursions which are not operated, supervised, controlled or endorsed in any way by us. They are provided by local operators or other third parties who are entirely independent of us. They do not form any part of your contract with us even where we suggest particular operators/other third parties and/or assist you in booking such activities or excursions in any way.<br /><br />We cannot accept any liability on any basis in relation to such activities or excursions and the acceptance of liability contained in clause 1.8(1) of our Booking Conditions will not apply to them. We do not however exclude liability for the negligence of ourselves or our employees resulting in your death or personal injury. We cannot guarantee accuracy at all times of information given in relation to such activities or excursions or about the area(s) you are visiting generally (except where this concerns the services which will form part of your contract) or that any particular excursion or activity which does not form part of our contract will take place as these services are not under our control.<br /><br />When making your booking of ‘extra services’ (such as excursions) we will arrange for you to enter into a contract with the supplier/principal of the extra services in question (the “Service Provider”) named on your receipt or confirmation invoice. When we on behalf of the Service Provider issue a written confirmation to you, this signifies that the Service Provider has entered into a contract with you. Please Note: we act as an agent in the sale of such extra services regardless of whether those extra services are purchased via ourselves or one of our in-resort Representatives. The information that we provide in our brochure, on our website and in resort has been provided by the Service Provider.<br /><br />As an agent we accept no responsibility for the acts or omissions of the Service Provider or for the services provided by the Service Provider. The Service Provider’s terms &amp; conditions will apply to your booking and we advise you to read these carefully as they do contain important information about your booking. Please ask us for copies of these if you do not have them. <br /><br /><strong>5.2: BOOKING EXTRAS</strong> <br />We’re delighted to be able to offer a whole host of extras to help you get the most out of your holiday with us, details of which can be found on our website and in our brochure. It’s advisable that you book any extras at the time of booking, as we cannot guarantee that they can be added later and prices can change at any time. If you add these extras after confirming your booking, you will be charged the price applicable at the time those extras are booked, not at the time the holiday itself was booked. We try wherever possible to obtain special offers and discounts from our chosen suppliers to pass on to our guests, though these are subject to availability and can be withdrawn at any time. Please ask our Reservations team about any applicable offers when confirming your booking.</p>
<p>Payment for optional activities and events booked in resort must be made at the point of booking by debit or credit card. Card payments will be taken in Euros or in sterling, which will be converted from the local currency price at the applicable exchange rate at that time. Exchange rate fluctuations may mean that the sterling price paid may not be exactly the same as the cost in local currency in your resort. Where paying with a Euro or Swiss Franc currency card, the local currency price in addition to a handling charge will be debited from your account. <br />Any activities or excursions that you choose to book whilst you are on holiday are not part of the package holiday provided by us. Your contract will be with the provider of the activity or excursion and not with Hotelplan Ltd. If activities or excursions are withdrawn by the provider for any reason, any refunds must be negotiated directly with the provider and cannot be guaranteed by us as we act as an agent for the provider.</p>
<p>If you are not entirely satisfied with the Service, you should contact your Resort Representative and the Service Provider immediately and attempt to resolve the problem on site during the holiday. This is very important, as it gives the Service Provider the opportunity to understand the nature of your concern, and respond quickly and effectively. Claims that have not been registered with the Service Provider and with us as soon as possible during your holiday cannot be accepted. The Service Provider and our Resort Representative should be given the opportunity to rectify a situation. Please help us and the Service Provider to help you by following this procedure. If after that you still feel that the problem has not been resolved to your satisfaction, you should within 14 days of the end of the holiday put comments in writing to us. Where it is not possible to resolve the concern directly with the Service Provider, you should contact our Resort Representative for assistance. <br /><br />If you fail to follow this simple complaints procedure, your right to claim any compensation you may otherwise have been entitled to may be affected or even lost as a result. We will endeavour to assist in resolving any dissatisfaction but do so purely on a goodwill basis and without any responsibility for any complaints or claims.<br /><br /><strong>5.3: CANCELLATION &amp; AMENDMENT</strong> <br />Should you wish to change or cancel any booking of extra services, you should send your request to us in writing, by email or post. If you have booked through a Travel Agent, you will need to contact them. Your request will take effect from the day we receive it. Please ensure that you have received written confirmation of any changes to your booking prior to travel, particularly if you requested the cancellation or amendment by phone. For more information, see clause 1.4.<br /><br /><strong>5.4: CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS BY THE SUPPLIER/PRINCIPAL</strong> <br />We will inform you of any changes or cancellations made by the Service Provider as soon as reasonably possible. If the Service Provider offers alternative arrangements or a refund, you will need to let us know your choice within the stipulated time frame. If you fail to do so the Service Provider is entitled to assume you wish to receive a full refund. We accept no liability for any changes or cancellations made to your arrangements by the Service Provider under your contract with them.<br /><br /><strong>5.5: OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR BOOKING</strong><br />Your contract is with the Service Provider and its booking conditions apply. As agent, we accept no responsibility for the actual provision of the extra services. Our responsibilities are limited to making the booking in accordance with your instructions, and taking payment on behalf of the Service Provider. <br /><br />We accept no responsibility for any information about the extra services that we pass on to you in good faith. However, in the event that we are found liable to you on any basis whatsoever, our maximum liability to you is limited to twice the cost of the commission earned in relation to your booking (or the appropriate proportion of this if not everyone on the booking is affected). We do not exclude or limit any liability for death or personal injury that arises as a result of our negligence or that of any of our employees whilst acting in the course of their employment.<br /><br /><strong>5.6: REFUNDS</strong><br />If you have booked any special activities, excursions or other services which do not form part of your package holiday contract and these are unavailable due to circumstances beyond our control, claims should be made under your own travel insurance policy. Please note refunds will not be made for any unused portion of your package holiday travel or accommodation arrangements which is not attributable to any failure on our part or the part of our suppliers to provide these services.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><br /><strong>6. GROUP DISCOUNTS AND CHILD DISCOUNTS</strong><br />We’re pleased to offer some great discounts to groups travelling together and to those travelling with children. These discounts are only available for bookings made 10 weeks prior to departure or earlier.</p>
<p><strong>6.1: GROUP DISCOUNTS</strong><br />To qualify as a group, all guests must book at the same time, for the same departure date, resort and duration, and all communication and payment must be organised through one named individual as the group leader. Group members may however travel by different routes or methods, and/or occupy different price room/apartment types.<br />• Group discounts are valid on bookings for groups of 10 full-fare paying guests or more. Discounts are based on the basic adult price after any supplier discounts from the hotel have been applied. Room or flight supplements, ski packs, ski/snowboard carriage and other ancillary costs are not included.<br />• The group size is calculated on the number of guests paying the full adult price quoted at time of booking. Any discounted child places are not counted towards the group and group discount.<br />• Group discounts cannot be combined with any other offers or discounts advertised. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• Group discounts do not apply in our Chalet properties, on Inghams Santa Breaks, holidays to Canada or within the following exclusion dates: 23/24 December, 30/31 December, 10/11 February and 19/20 April.<br />• Later additions can be made to your group, subject to availability, but the original group discount will not be increased as a result of such additions. If your group size reduces after booking, the group discount will be reduced accordingly and may be lost completely if all group conditions are no longer complied with. Re-costing of the holiday may apply if room occupancy levels change.<br />• We have specific allocations of rooms at special rates in most hotels. If extra rooms are required to accommodate your group these may not be available at the same preferential rate, in which case ‘extra to allocation’ supplements may apply. If we have obtained such extra rooms to accommodate your group, we reserve the right to re-cost the holiday if your group later reduces in size.<br />• A £150 per person deposit is required from all group members. Full payment must be made at least 10 weeks prior to departure, by debit card or credit card.<br />• The names of all group members are required at the time of booking for all scheduled flights, and any subsequent change will incur an amendment fee, or with some scheduled airlines, cancellation and re-booking. For all charter flights, names are required within 14 days of booking, but we allow free name changes up to 28 days prior to departure, after which an administration fee for any further changes will apply. For scheduled services, charges will apply for any name change.<br />• Only one invoice will normally be issued per group, to the group leader.<br />• The group leader is responsible for ensuring that every member of his/her group has appropriate travel insurance for their needs.<br />• We reserve the right to restrict to amend or withdraw this offer at any time. Equally, we reserve the right to limit the group discounts allowed across multiple groups in the same property on the same date at any time.<br />• All group bookings are ‘subject to availability’ which includes respecting the right of hoteliers to decline single-sex groups or groups above a certain size.<br />• We strongly recommend pre-booking ski/snowboard carriage and ski packs at the time of booking, to avoid disappointment and ensure a smooth process on arrival in resort.<br /><br /><strong>6.2: CHILD DISCOUNTS</strong><br />Except where stated, child discounted places are based on the child/children sharing the room with at least two full-paying guests. A maximum of two discounted child places is permitted per room/suite/cabin/apartment.<br />• Child discount percentages are calculated off the basic adult price at time of booking, not including room or flight supplements, ski packs, ski/snowboard carriage, childcare, insurance or any other applicable costs.<br />• Children on self-drive or accommodation-only holidays receive the same percentage discounts shown for European charter flights off the relevant adult basic self-drive or accommodation-only price. <br />• Infants under 2 years of age on the return travel date to the UK pay an Infant Administration Fee as shown below, provided that the infant travels on a parent’s lap, and no flight, coach or train seat is used:<br />- £49 (when using charter flights) in European hotels and apartments, with direct payment to the accommodation owner of any cot-hire and linen charges, food and drink costs or other applicable charges (£99 on scheduled flights).<br />- £179 for Canada holidays, on the same basis as above.<br />- £115 in our own-run chalet and Hotel properties, where travel-cot hire, linen, baby food, use of highchair and changing mat is included in this price.<br />• Please note that infants do not have their own luggage allowance, and must sit on a parent’s lap on the flight and on the transfers.<br />• The child reductions may be changed or withdrawn at any time. The correct price will be confirmed at time of booking.<br />• If dual parent families abuse our single parent discounts, we reserve the right to either cancel such bookings without notice or to re-invoice the booking at the correct price.<br />• As they are by definition not ‘full-paying guests’ children receiving a discount do not count<br />- towards the size of a Group for the purposes of calculating any Group Reduction<br />- towards the occupancy figure in European apartments/cabins/suites for the purposes of calculating any applicable under-occupancy supplements. (In the likely event that the under-occupancy supplements make the total family price higher with the child discount than without, we will simply cost the holiday at the adult price, and give each child (max. 2 children) a special reduction of £50 per child. <br /><strong> </strong><br /><strong>7. IN RESORT</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1: REPRESENTATIVE SERVICE</strong> <br />We provide the services of a local Representative, who will either be based in the resort, provide a visiting service, or be available by telephone. If you require any assistance during your stay, please get in touch with your Representative, whose details will be available in your Welcome Pack and/or on arrival at your accommodation.<br /><br /><strong>7.2: SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS</strong><br />For your own safety and that of other mountain users, please refer to the Mountain Safety information included in your Welcome Pack provided prior to your arrival in resort.<br /><br /><strong>7.3: FREE MINIBUS/SKI-BUS</strong><br />Where free minibus/ski-bus services are advertised, these may be subject to capacity restrictions, and/or be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis and could only run at set times, details of which are available in resort. We cannot be held responsible if you miss any, all or part of your ski lessons or other arrangements as a result of the late running or unavailability of these services. Similarly, we will not be liable to arrange alternative services should the free minibus/ski-bus service be withdrawn by the supplier.<br /><br /><strong>7.4: HIGH ALTITUDE RESORTS</strong> <br />You should be aware that some people experience difficulties in high altitude resorts and it may be advisable to seek advice from your doctor before travel if you have any medical conditions which this may exacerbate.<br /><br />Where a resort is described as being at high altitude or with “guaranteed snow”, this describes a resort with skiing over 2000 metres on its area lift pass and with a history of reliable skiing, but does not mean that skiable snow is guaranteed on all runs and all altitudes at all times or on the slopes of that individual resort. <br /><br /><strong>7.5: SKI-IN/SKI-OUT</strong><br />Where accommodation is described as offering “doorstep skiing” or “ski-in/ski-out” this is obviously subject to individual skiers’ ability and snow conditions in resort. This is generally defined as being possible to ski to/from a point within 50m of that property, but may be obstructed by paths or foliage. We cannot be held liable if the local authorities and/or local property owners, including the owner of the property in which you are staying, make changes to the property or surrounding area which affect the use of the intended ski in/ski out route. Where distance is quoted in time taken to walk, we have used as a guideline that 100m takes an adult one minute to walk in standard footwear under snow and ice-clear conditions. Clearly, timings will vary according to footwear, age, personal fitness and surface conditions. <br /><br /><strong>7.6: LOCAL INDUSTRIAL ACTION</strong> <br />Hotelplan Ltd cannot accept responsibility for any losses incurred as a result of industrial action in resort e.g. strike action by lift operators, bus drivers, ski schools etc. Equally, where other factors such as weather or other force majeure events impact on the availability of some resort facilities and services, including the operation of ski lifts, any refunds must be negotiated with the supplier.<br /><br /><strong>7.7: RESORT DEVELOPMENT &amp; NOISE</strong> <br />If we are informed of any building works at or in close proximity to your accommodation that may, in our reasonable view, significantly affect the enjoyment of your holiday, we will do our best to forewarn you about it prior to your departure. Please note that such works may not be carried out by the providers of accommodation featured online or in our brochure, and may be outside of their control. <br /><br />We would urge you to read the resort and accommodation descriptions carefully to identify sources of noise which might exist or might be expected to exist, i.e. roads, bars, discos, etc. However, it is impossible to predict noise created by individuals, machinery or traffic, i.e. temporary noise disturbances. Live music/noise from bars which are adjacent to or part of any properties we feature may extend their opening hours, especially on public holidays, and opening times may differ from those published. <br /><br />On occasions, the sites of building works may lie dormant during winter months, with no work resuming until weather conditions improve in spring/summer, although some machinery, cranes, scaffolding, etc. may remain in situ throughout. We will not ordinarily pre-advise guests of such non-operational sites. We will not always be aware of all/any works or festivities occurring in your resort, and therefore will be unable to advise you before you travel. Equally, if a lift office, ski school or tourist board deem it necessary to amend, cancel or change facilities or services offered, that is done entirely at their discretion, not ours. If works are due to be carried out across more than one season, we will update guests once the season has started and not before, as things may change at any time. No refund or compensation is payable for any non-operation of any property facilities that have not been advertised by us or if you choose to upgrade your accommodation in resort with the supplier.<br /><br /><strong>7.8: IN-RESORT PURCHASES</strong> <br />Payment for ski packs, excursions, optional activities, etc. booked in resort must be made at the point of booking by debit card or credit card. Card payments can either be taken in local currency (subject to charges by your bank) or sterling converted from the local currency price at the applicable exchange rate at that time. Exchange rate fluctuations may mean that the sterling price paid may not be exactly the same as the cost in local currency in your resort. Where paying with a Euro or Swiss Franc currency card, the local currency price will be debited from your account.</p>
<p>Any activities, excursions, Optional Adventures or ski packs that you may choose to book or pay for in addition to your package holiday whilst you are on holiday are not part of your package holiday provided by us. For any activity, excursion or ski pack not booked as part of your package holiday, your contract will be with the provider of the activity, excursion or ski pack and not with Hotelplan Ltd. We are not responsible for the provision of the activity, excursion or ski pack or for anything that happens during the course of its provision by the provider. <br /><br />Please note this includes all sporting activities including hazardous activities. It is your responsibility to act with due care at all times and to be insured to the levels reasonably required for your circumstances and the activity concerned.<br /><br />Many of the services which make up your holiday are provided by independent suppliers. Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier’s liability to you, usually in accordance with applicable International Conventions or EU regulations. Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from ourselves or the supplier concerned. Please note, the conditions of suppliers of equipment hired or otherwise made available to you as part of our contract with you make you responsible for any damage to or loss of that equipment.<br /><br /><strong>7.9: ACTIVITIES &amp; EXCURSIONS</strong><br />Parents are reminded that children must remain under their control at all times. Age limits or qualifications may apply to several activities and it may be that a basic or reasonable level of fitness is required to partake in a certain activity or a requirement of swimming to take part in water-based activities. On occasion, passport evidence may also be required. Our Reservations team has full details and you should enquire before booking if any limitations to activities are of paramount importance to you.</p>
<p>No guarantee is given as to the specific length or time duration of each activity and some activities will require excess payments to be made for insurance purposes to partake in that activity. Each specific supplier will provide more details in resort.</p>
<p>On our winter activities, some may rely on satisfactory levels of snow and/or ice and should the levels be inappropriate, providers will do their best to offer alternative activities. A full driving licence is often required and must be produced on request before driving snowmobiles, and passport evidence may be required. Strict drink-driving laws apply to snowmobile driving, as with any vehicle. <br /><br />For the use of most motorised vehicles, for example snowmobiles and skidoos, most travel insurance policies will offer cover for personal injury and medical expenses but will not cover damage to the vehicle itself. Therefore, the provider may take and retain for the duration of the activity an insurance deposit or excess, often in the region of €800.<br /><br />Minimum numbers and/or suitable weather conditions are required for certain activities to take place. If the required numbers are not reached, or the weather prevents the activity taking place at all during your holiday, or the activity is withdrawn by the provider for any reason, any refunds must be negotiated directly with the provider and cannot be guaranteed by us as we act as an agent and are not responsible for the provision of the service or activity normally.</p>
<p>Some excursions are subject to minimum numbers. It may also be the case that excursions do not start directly from the resort you are booked to stay in, and you may incur additional charges in travelling to the excursion departure point. Excursions can also be shared between resorts and the point of origin may not be from your resort.</p>
<p>No refunds or compensation will be paid by the service providers if you simply change your mind about taking part in an activity after booking it, or miss the transport provided, or fail to arrive at the designated meeting point on time, or, in your or the provider’s judgment, you cannot physically cope with the activity (if the latter is due to a physical injury, you should claim under your travel insurance policy).<br />Any arrangements made by you independently of our company are entirely at your own risk and you should make sure you are appropriately insured.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Walks:</strong> Where guided walks are available through us in the resort, routes are subject to change. All walks are subject to availability of local guides, weather conditions and maximum numbers. Early booking is strongly recommended. Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking. The decision of the guide on the suitability of the walk for you is final and no compensation will be paid where the guide believes, in their professional opinion, that it is not suitable. Walks are not recommended for guests under 12 years. Any guests under 18 years will need to be accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p>Full details of the walks with the meeting points and routes will be provided to you on arrival. Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavour to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions. You may need to travel on foot or by public transport to reach the start/finish point of the guided walk. These costs are not included in your package holiday cost and should be paid by you locally where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Activities in Lapland:</strong> The activities described will not necessarily take place in the exact order in which they are described on the website/in the brochure and, due to circumstances outside our control, it may be necessary to vary the itineraries at very short notice. Hotelplan Ltd reserves the right to do this when necessary. The date and time of all pre-booked excursions and activities will be confirmed in resort. It is often not possible to confirm a specific date and time prior to departure.<br /><br />The length of the rides shown in our itineraries is a guideline only, and may vary according to safety or weather conditions, the number of huskies and reindeer available, and other issues beyond our control and no guarantee is given as to the specific length of each ride.<br /><br />‘Huskies’ is the generic term for the range of breeds used by Lapland’s dog-sled providers. Some features included in the itineraries rely on satisfactory levels of snow and ice and, should the levels be inappropriate, suppliers will do their best to offer alternative activities. Insufficient snow or ice is not considered a reason to cancel or grounds for compensation.<br /><br />Safety instructions are given prior to each activity or safari, not including tobogganing and other similar informal activities, and parents are reminded that children must remain under their care and control at all times. There is a minimum age of 18 years to drive a husky sled, and there is usually a minimum size and weight requirement, for safety reasons.<br /><br />During snowmobile excursions, children are transported in a separate sled driven by the guide, whilst parents drive or are a passenger on a separate snowmobile. Young children cannot ride pillion on a snowmobile and the recommended minimum height to ride pillion is usually 1.40m.<br /><br />As most activities take place outdoors in Arctic conditions, they are not all suitable for babies and very young children. We take advice from our suppliers daily on whether children under 4 years old should be allowed to participate in certain activities due to weather conditions and other factors. No refund or compensation is applicable if young children and the accompanying carer are unable to take part in a particular activity. If any activity, whether pre-booked in the UK or booked locally, does not ultimately take place, the liability of Hotelplan Ltd is limited to a refund of the price paid for that specific activity only, and no additional compensation will be payable.<br /><br />Whilst it is hoped that the Northern Lights will appear for our guests, this natural phenomena can never be guaranteed and no refund or compensation is applicable should they not be visible.<br /><br />We endeavour to ensure that all activities booked through us are undertaken with reasonable skill and care in accordance with local laws, regulations and customs. However, it is not feasible to make the activity programmes completely risk free and it is a condition of your booking that you accept that you are taking risks and that it is your responsibility to be insured to the levels reasonably required for your circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Adventures and the Arctic Circle Centre (Santa’s Lapland):</strong> All of our Optional Adventures and the activities at the Arctic Circle Centre on your Search for Santa Day are provided by Lapland Safaris (or Star Arctic, if you are staying there), who have issued the below safety guidance in accordance with the activities which they operate.</p>
<p><strong>FOR YOUR SAFETY with Lapland Safaris/Star Arctic</strong></p>
<p>Your safety as always is our priority, therefore we would like to draw your attention to the following safety rules:<br />1. Please note that snow and ice on surfaces can be slippery even when surfaces are gritted. Please be careful when walking outside.<br />2. You must follow the instructions and safety rules issued by Lapland Safaris/Hotel Star Arctic or its suppliers’ personnel in every respect. For reasons related to your own safety and that of others, please acknowledge that failure to comply with these instructions may revoke a participant’s right to continue on the program and any right for a refund or other compensation.<br />3. Please note that activities such as snowmobile, reindeer and husky rides, can be physically demanding and that participants may be exposed to different kinds of physical strain. <br />a) Therefore, if you have any illness or disabilities (for instance heart disease, asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, back or hip problems) that could affect your ability to take part in these activities, please acknowledge that you take part in this service at your own risk. Should you have any questions, please contact staff at the activity site.<br />b) These activities can involve some risk to pregnant women for example, carbon monoxide, vibration and other physical strain.<br />4. All animals used in the safaris (reindeer rides, horse rides and husky rides) are trained as far as it is possible for the activity. However, behaviour of animals can never be fully predicted and therefore, in order to reduce risks, given safety and other instructions have to be obeyed.<br />5. Snowmobiles as motorised vehicles can be dangerous especially if not operated with caution and according to given safety and driving instructions. Please, obey all given instructions.<br />6. You must have a valid driving licence and be at least 18 years old. If this is not the case, you cannot operate a snowmobile or other motorised vehicle.<br />7. Please note that driving a motorised vehicle under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating drugs is prohibited by Finnish law. You may not drive any motorised vehicle if you are under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating drugs.<br />8. Our snowmobiles are insured as required by the Finnish Traffic Insurance Act. This insurance covers medical care for personal injuries, which arise out of an accident, to the driver and the passenger (if any) as well as any outsiders, as determined in the policy of the insurance company.<br />9. As a snowmobile operator, you are liable for the damages you cause to the snowmobile. The amount of the compulsory deductible expenses is at most €1,500 per driver/snowmobile/ incident. This amount must be paid immediately.<br /><br /><strong>Lapland Climate:</strong> In December, temperatures in Lapland normally range between -7˚c and -35˚c, with daylight usually limited to between 10:30 and 14:00 and long periods of twilight either side of night.</p>
<p>Whilst thermal suits and boots are provided on some of our Lapland holidays (see specific holiday details), you are advised to bring layers of thermal and fleeced clothing to wear underneath when you are outdoors. Several layers of clothing provide better insulation from the cold than one or two thick items. Balaclavas, face masks and extra warm headgear are also suggested. The heating in hotels is usually extremely efficient, so lighter clothing is required indoors.</p>
<p><strong>7.10: LOST PROPERT</strong>Y<br />A report of any lost item must be made immediately to your Resort Representative if the loss is noticed whilst you are on holiday, including on transfers to and from resort.</p>
<p>If the item is not found and returned to you prior to your departure, you must report the loss to your Resort Representative by text or phone, using the contact details you will be provided with during your holiday. Alternatively, you can contact us by email at <strong>lostpropertyCOUNTRY@inghams.co.uk</strong>, replacing ‘COUNTRY’ with the country that you travelled to.</p>
<p>Please do give us a full description of the item lost, including any branding/distinguishing features. <br />If found, you will need to arrange collection by courier at your expense. This is due to increased customs charges both in the UK and abroad. Our overseas team will package your item securely and assist with arranging for collection from an appropriate overseas address, for which a €15 admin fee will be payable. It may be possible for some smaller items to be returned to the UK by staff on overseas visits, though this is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the return of any item of lost property and our staff’s involvement in tracing it shall not constitute acceptance of any liability for the item at any stage of the process, particularly if arrangements have not been made via our UK office as above. We regret that any items of lost property found and unclaimed 28 days after the holiday end date cannot be kept and will be disposed of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br /><strong>8. SKI PACK</strong></p>
<p>Your ski extras can be booked before you go, in most cases up to 48 hours before departure. Current prices will be displayed on the website, or advised over the phone by our Reservations team. Prices are subject to change and special offers may be withdrawn at any time. Most offers have to be booked in advance and aren’t available locally.</p>
<p><strong>8.1: SKI LESSONS</strong><br />If you know that you will require lessons, we advise you to pre-book regardless of the date of your holiday. Our grading system (for adults and children) is to help you and our resorts ensure that the correct classes are pre-booked prior to your arrival. Please ensure that you discuss your needs with our reservations or resort teams prior to booking, to ensure that the appropriate level is booked in advance as ski schools cannot always guarantee movements between classes.</p>
<p>Our resort pages will have the most up-to-date information about lessons, but these are subject to change by the ski/snowboard school. The duration and timing of lessons varies depending on the resort and type of lesson. Most instructors speak a good level of English and there will often be a mix of nationalities in group lessons. Likewise there may be a mix of adults and children in each group.</p>
<p>Throughout the season, and in particular during the continental school holidays (our reservations staff have the dates), the length, timing and availability of the ski school lessons can change with little warning. Ski schools are also extremely busy and it is imperative that you book in advance to avoid disappointment. Occasionally resorts ask that a minimum number of guests book into a lesson in order for it to go ahead. In the unlikely event your lesson is cancelled due to low numbers, alternative arrangements will be offered if possible, however you will be responsible for any additional costs incurred. Alternative arrangements might not be for the same duration as originally booked, but will be to the same monetary value. The ski school price quoted is that of the ski school’s standard group lessons. <br /><br />Private lessons can be booked in advance at certain times and in certain resorts, please discuss your requirements with our reservations team. <br /><br /><strong>8.2: EQUIPMENT HIRE</strong><br />The equipment is priced according to the grade of ski you choose. If you require a ski boot larger than size 12, please advise us at the time of booking so that we can inform the resort in advance. We strongly recommend that you check that your personal insurance covers you for loss/damage to hired equipment. Ski-hire shops may offer insurance to you and we recommend that you accept this if your own travel insurance policy does not cover you.<br />Helmets: In Italy it is compulsory for anyone under the age of 18 to wear a helmet when skiing.<br /><br /><strong>8.3: LIFT PASSES</strong><br />Beginners do not always require a lift pass for the first days of skiing. <br />Some resorts may offer discounted rates for Senior or disabled persons and walkers intending not to ski. If not detailed in the ski pack panel for your chosen resort, please ask at the point of booking or with our staff in resort. Most resorts operate an electronic lift pass, for which you pay a deposit in resort (generally refundable at the end of your holiday).<br /><br />At the beginning and end of season, or at any other time due to snow or other weather conditions, resorts may limit the number of lifts in operation. Hotelplan accepts no liability in such situations; you may however have the potential to claim under your travel insurance if the provider has made no refund in resort. The lift pass provider will normally only consider a refund where the lift pass has not been activated. We recommend that you make a note of your lift pass number (taking a photo is ideal), in case of loss.<br /><br /><strong>Children’s Free Lift Passes/Equipment &amp; Family Lift Passes</strong><br />Each resort has different criteria for the ages of children eligible for free or reduced prices. In many resorts, children’s free passes will require the purchase of the same type and duration lift pass as purchased by the parents. In some resorts, Family Lift Passes are available but with certain stipulations relating to the composition of the family grouping. Please ask our reservations or resort staff when booking. <br /><br /><strong>8.4: SNOW &amp; WEATHER</strong><br />Whilst we obviously cannot guarantee snow, all our resorts are chosen for their reliable snow records. Many of our resorts also have the advantage of glaciers, which ensure snow almost all year round. Snow conditions can change dramatically overnight, and will not be accepted as a valid reason for you to cancel your ski or Lapland holiday. If there is such poor snow that the lift company and ski-school in your booked resort decide that you are unable to ski, we will endeavour to transport you daily to another ski area, where appropriate.</p>
<p>Slopes, pistes or lifts may be temporarily closed by the local providers or authorities, particularly if there is too much snow or there are high winds. If the lift pass provider in the affected area permits a partial refund where this occurs, we will of course pass this on to you. If the lift pass provider does not issue a refund, claims will need to be directed to your travel insurance provider.<br /><br /><strong>8.5: FLIGHT DELAYS</strong><br />If your flight is delayed and you “lose” a day’s equipment or lift pass, we regret that we are not able to make any refund in respect of pre-booked equipment or lift passes. A pro-rata refund should be claimed from your travel insurance.<br /><br /><strong>8.6: REFUNDS</strong> <br />If you have booked any special activities, excursions or other services which do not form part of your package holiday contract and these are unavailable due to circumstances beyond our control, claims should be made under your own travel insurance policy. Please note refunds will not be made for any unused portion of your package holiday travel or accommodation arrangements which is not attributable to any failure on our part or the part of our suppliers to provide these services.</p>]]></bodyText>
