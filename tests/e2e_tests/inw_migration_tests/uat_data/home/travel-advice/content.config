<p><a name="EHIC"></a><strong>Medical Treatment</strong> - For the time being, reciprocal agreements remain in place in some EU countries enabling citizens of member countries to receive some free medical treatment on production of an European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). You can<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" target="_blank"> apply online for the EHIC</a> using the link above. We highly recommend taking out further medical cover as part of your travel insurance and not relying exclusively on these arrangements since they may not be very comprehensive plus do not cover any insurance matters outside of health. It may be that it is a condition of your travel insurance that you have an EHIC card covering you for initial treatment.</p>
<p><a name="FCO"></a><strong>The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Travel Advice Unit</strong> may have issued information about your holiday destination. You are advised to check the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/travel" target="_blank">FCO website</a> for the latest advice. You might also like to read through their range of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/travel-abroad" target="_blank">special-interest pages for different types of travellers</a> who may need different types of advice.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ABTA"></a>Alternatively,</strong><strong> the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.abta.com/" target="_blank">ABTA Information Department</a></strong> can provide advice on travel related subjects and can verify ABTA membership details. ABTA is the UK's Premier Trade Association for Tour Operators and Travel Agents. ABTA's main aims are to maintain high standards of trading practice for the benefit of its Members, the travel industry at large, and the consumers that they serve.</p>
<p><strong><a name="passports-visas"></a>Passports &amp; Visas <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/passports" target="_blank">(The United Kingdom Passport Service)</a><br /></strong>It is your responsibility to be in possession of a valid passport and any visa that may be necessary. If you hold a Commonwealth or non-British passport, please check visa regulations with the embassy or consulate of the country you will be visiting. You should allow ample time when making visa applications and check for any changes in visa/passport requirements that a country may make at any time.</p>
<p>From November 2024 we expect to see the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) – an automated IT system for registering non-EU nationals travelling for a short stay (up to 90 days within any 180 day period) each time they cross the external borders of European countries. It is anticipated that this will replace passport stamping and automate border control procedures. For more information on EES, please visit:<span> </span><a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees/general-information_en">General information - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>
<p>From 2025 onwards the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will be effective, which will require visa-exempt EU nationals, including UK citizens, to hold an electronic authorisation to travel to or within the Schengen Zone (currently 27 EU member states, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus). An ETIAS travel authorisation is a visa waiver which will be required regardless of the length of your visit. Once granted, it will be valid for 3 years or until your passport expires. It can only be applied for online and a fee will be payable unless an exemption applies. If you are unable to travel on your holiday because you have not obtained an ETIAS travel authorisation, our normal cancellation charges will apply. For more information on ETIAS, please visit:<span> </span><a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias/what-etias_en">What is ETIAS - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>

<p><a name="knowbeforeyougo"></a><strong>Know Before You Go - </strong>The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office’s <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/knowbeforeyougo/" target="_blank">'Know Before You Go' (KBYG)</a> is an ongoing campaign to ensure travellers get adequate travel insurance, have the necessary passport and visa documentation, leave emergency contact information with someone and tell them where you are going, have enough money and have access to emergency funds, visit GPs before travelling as appropriate, familiarise themselves with the destination’s local laws and customs and check the FCO’s country travel advice. For details, see the FCO website.</p>
<p><a name="canada"></a><strong>Canada Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - </strong>Canada operate Advance Visa Waiver programmes for which you must have a 'chipped' passport to qualify and are required to complete registration before departure.
