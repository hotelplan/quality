<p> </p>
<p>On 4<sup>th</sup> March 2020, Flybe formally ceased trading. If you are an Inghams guest booked on a Flybe flight, please read the below information carefully. This page will be updated as new information becomes available, so please check back regularly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>For guests currently on holiday with us, booked on a Flybe flight:</strong></p>
<p>We will pass on details of your new flight arrangements to your resort representative who will speak with you in due course.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>For guests yet to travel and booked on a Flybe flight:</strong></p>
<p>We are making every effort to re-arrange alternative flights, and will contact you as soon as we have details of what has been organised for you, or to discuss options if no appropriate replacement flight is available. We ask that you do not book your own flights as we will not be able to reimburse you for any costs incurred, please wait for us to contact you.</p>
<p>As a responsible tour operator, please be assured that your holiday with Inghams is entirely protected. As soon as we have details of your new flight information, we will of course be in touch. If you have booked via a travel agent, we will liaise with them.  In the meantime, please do bear with us as we make these arrangements. As we are sure you can appreciate, demand for replacement flights will be high and rebooking may take some time.</p>
<p>We politely ask that you do not contact us to request updates, as this will only slow the rebooking process. Thank you for your patience.</p>]]></bodyText>
