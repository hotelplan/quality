  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Please visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://my.inghams.co.uk" target="_blank">Manage My Booking</a> to enter your APIS details</p>
<p>For security reasons the US, most EU States, and other countries now require airlines to provide details about their passengers before they travel. This is known as Advance Passenger Information (API).</p>
<p><strong>What is Advance Passenger Information?</strong></p>
<p>Advance Passenger Information (API) (sometimes called APIS) is information required by specific governments prior to travel. It is information taken from your travel document, normally your passport and the data will be sent to the appropriate countries’ government agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I have to supply API?</strong></p>
<p>All airlines are required to submit Advanced Passenger Information details in advance of travel to specific countries government Border Control and Security authorities. This allows the authorities to make routine identity checks on passengers before arrival.</p>
<p><strong>How can I supply API?</strong></p>
<p>For details of where to supply this information please see the Transport section of your travel itinerary.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to supply?</strong></p>
<p>You need to supply APIS information from the travel document (usually passport) that you intend to use for travel to your destination. Please ensure that the travel document is valid for your destination. <span>If you wish to be kept updated during periods of travel delay, we would strongly recommend that you provide your mobile number, so that we may communicate up-to-date information to you via our Text Alert system. If you have booked through a Travel Agent and they provide their own contact details, they then assume responsibility for passing on any text information received to you.</span></p>
<p><strong>When do I need to supply Advance Passenger Information?</strong></p>
<p>We would like you to supply API data as soon as you can after you receive your travel itinerary. For late bookings made within 14 &amp; 7 days of departure you will still be able to add your APIS information up to 7 days before departure. If you're travelling within 7 days of making your booking, you will need to provide your API information at check-in.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I do not supply API?</strong></p>
<p>All airlines are required to collect and transmit API data for those governments that legally require the provision of API data. If for any reason you cannot enter your details online the data will be collected at check-in by an automatic passport reader.</p>
<p><strong>Full instructions on how and where to provide API will be provided with your travel documents which you will receive 14 days before departure.</strong></p>]]></bodyText>
