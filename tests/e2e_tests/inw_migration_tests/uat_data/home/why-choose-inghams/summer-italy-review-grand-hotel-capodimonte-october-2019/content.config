  <description><![CDATA[The hotel, their staff and the Inghams rep, Marcella, were all fantastic. They couldn't do enough to help, give information and to make my holiday something to remember. The excursions I booked were all excellent value for money and the guides were so knowledgeable. The hotel provided a varied vegetarian meal option. Couldn't have asked for more.]]></description>
