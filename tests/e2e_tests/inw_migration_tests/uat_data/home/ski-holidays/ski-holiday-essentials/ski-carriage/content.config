<p>If you have your own equipment you will need to pre-book ski carriage. We strongly recommend pre-booking ski carriage as early as possible to ensure your space is reserved. With a limited allocation on each flight, ski carriage is available on a first-come, first-served basis. To avoid disappointment, it’s best to confirm your ski carriage at the time of booking your holiday.</p>

<h2>Ski carriage on charter flights</h2>
<a name="03"></a>
<p>Inghams have chartered airlines to fly several routes to the mountains this winter. On our chartered flights we offer a standard charge of <strong style="color: #023761;">£40</strong> per set of skis/snowboard for return ski carriage.</p>
<p>Book ski carriage on an Inghams charter flight and if for any reason your skis don’t make the flight, we’ll ensure you’re provided with FREE equipment rental in resort, until your skis are delivered to you.</p>

<h2>Ski carriage on low cost and scheduled flights</h2>
<a name="04"></a>
<p>In addition to our chartered flights, we can also offer seats on selected low cost and scheduled flights using airlines such as EasyJet and British Airways. Low cost and scheduled airlines charge separately for outbound and inbound ski carriage, and prices vary depending on the airline.</p>
<p>To book ski carriage on a low cost or scheduled flight, call the airline directly. The airline will confirm ski carriage charges directly with you.</p>

<h2>Scheduled flights with…</h2>
<a name="05"></a>
<p><strong style="color: #023761;">FREE ski carriage with Swiss International Airlines</strong></p>
<p>Switzerland is often viewed as an expensive ski destination but the country represents excellent value for money. Fly to Switzerland on a Swiss International Airlines scheduled flight and your ski/board carriage is included for FREE. Just one of many reasons to ski in Switzerland this winter.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #023761;">FREE ski carriage with Air Canada</strong></p>

<h2>Buying skis in resort</h2>
<a name="06"></a>
<p>A pair of skis, or a snowboard, can be a great ski holiday souvenir. And the mountain is the best place to test your skis and snowboard before you buy.</p>
<p>If you plan buying your own skis this winter, we strongly recommend making arrangements for ski and snowboard carriage before you go on holiday. With an Inghams charter flight we can only book ski carriage for both your outbound and inbound flight, you cannot book ski carriage one-way. Ski carriage for your return will not be available at check-in on your return.</p>
<p>Scheduled and low cost airlines may have availability for skis on your return journey. It is best to confirm with your airline before you travel.</p>

<h2>How to pack for ski carriage</h2>
<a name="07"></a>
<p>Please note that each ski carriage charge is for one ski or snowboarding bag and should only contain one pair of skis/snowboard and poles. Airlines may refuse to accept ski bags containing additional clothing, helmets and boots.</p>

<div class="white_box_shadow">
<h2>Insurance for ski carriage</h2>
<a name="08"></a>
<p>We advise you make sure your ski/travel insurance policy covers your ski carriage arrangements. Neither Inghams nor the airline can accept liability for non-delivery or damage to any item transported as a part of your ski carriage.</p>
<p>Inghams will provide free ski hire in the event of your skis not arriving at the destination airport when you have pre-booked ski carriage on an Inghams charter flight. Free ski hire will be provided for the duration of your holiday or until your skis are delivered to you in resort –whichever happens sooner.</p>
