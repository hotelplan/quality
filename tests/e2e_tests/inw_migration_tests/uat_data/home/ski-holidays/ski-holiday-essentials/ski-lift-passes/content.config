<p>Your lift pass is an essential bit of kit for your ski holiday. Without one, you can’t access the ski slopes. Each ski resort will have its own lift pass office issuing local area passes. Some resorts will be part of a much larger area, with the lift pass office offering both local and whole area passes. With Inghams you can pre-book your lift pass, adding on it onto your holiday before you go away.</p>

<h2>Why pre-book your lift pass?</h2>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: #023761;">Great choice of lift passes </strong>– we offer a wide choice of pre-bookable lift passes, from whole area and local area passes, to senior lift passes, youth lift passes and family lift passes. In some resorts we even have pre-bookable non-skier lift passes.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: #023761;">No paying for your pass while on holiday </strong>– pre-book your pass at the time of booking and you don’t have to pay the balance until 10 weeks before departure . As your lift pass is paid for in advance, you don’t have to dip into your daily holiday budget while you’re away.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: #023761;">Special offers – </strong>look out at the time of booking for special offers on pre-bookable lift passes, such as BOGOHP for Tignes and Val d'Isere - Buy one get one half price on all 6 day lift passes for 27 Jan, 9 &amp; 30 Mar 2024 (while stocks last).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Senior and youth lift passes</h2>
<p>Many ski resorts offer reductions on lift passes for senior skiers (69+ in most resorts) and teenagers (children between 12 and 17 years old in most resorts). Where these passes are available, they will become bookable as soon as you load ages into your ski holiday booking.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> proof of age may be requested in resort. Reductions are offered based on the age of the guest at the time of their holiday (first day of skiing for senior passes, and last day for youth passes).</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="white_box_shadow"><a name="family"></a>
<h2>Family and child lift passes</h2>
<p>Children will frequently have access to cheaper lift passes than adults. Different ski resorts may have different requirements for child lift passes, children are usually recognised as those under 11 years old, but you should check your resort page for exact details. If you’re skiing with the family, family lift passes, which are available in selected resorts, are another cost effective way of skiing together.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class="white_box_shadow"><a name="nonskier"></a>
<h2>Non-skiers lift pass</h2>
<p>In some ski resorts special passes are available for non-skiers, for activities such as winter walking. Please check availability of pre-bookable non-skier lift passes on the resort pages. Non-skier passes are frequently offered by local lift pass offices, and if you can’t find the pass you’re looking for, our representatives can help you to purchase a non-skiers pass in resort.</p>
