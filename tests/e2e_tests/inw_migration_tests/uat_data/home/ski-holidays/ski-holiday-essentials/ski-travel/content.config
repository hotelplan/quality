  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We firmly believe your holiday begins the moment you leave home, so we have done everything we possibly can to make sure your journey to and from resort is as smooth as possible.</p>
<p><strong><u>Travel options:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fly</strong></p>
<p>With more regional flight departures than any other company, flying direct from 21 UK airports. Our range of UK airports helps keep your journey times to a minimum, and for your added convenience, we can also arrange your airport car-parking or an overnight airport hotel for you in advance – see details below.</p>
<p>We also have a range of convenient transfer options between our overseas airports and your holiday resort. These include coach transfers, private transfers, rail transfers and car hire options, which are listed below.  </p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/getting-to-resort/fly"><strong>here</strong></a> for full information on our flight options.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Drive</strong></p>
<p>Save up to £100 per person &amp; gain a sense of independence. </p>
<p>Especially popular with guests booking our apartment holidays. No luggage restrictions, no ski carriage charges, stop enroute to load up with food and make big savings on wine at the local hypermarket! </p>
<p>If you're staying in an apartment, bed linen and towels are included so you don't need to bring your own. All studios and apartments have well equipped kitchens or kitchenettes usually with a dishwasher to help keep the chores to a minimum. </p>
<p>And a self-drive holiday doesn't mean any reduction in the service you'll receive. Your Inghams representative will be on hand when you arrive to help you settle in, direct you to the ski hire shop and generally help you get your bearings! </p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/getting-to-resort/self-drive"><strong>here</strong></a> for full information on our Self-Drive options.</p>
<p><strong><u>Transfer options combinable with flight options:</u></strong></p>
<p>Our holiday prices include return transfers between your overseas airport and resort. Your transfer will normally be by coach, rail or included car hire depending on your resort and flight. We also offer private transfers to many resorts.</p>
<p><strong>Coach transfer</strong></p>
<p>Your holiday price includes return transfers between your overseas airport and resort. Transfers are normally by coach or rail depending on your resort and flight. Although occasionally it may be necessary to ask you to wait for guests arriving on other flights, we are committed to reducing waiting times to a minimum.</p>
<p>Please note: Feeder services may sometimes be used.</p>
<p>Adverse weather, unusually heavy traffic or flight diversions may cause delays beyond our reasonable control. On peak holiday dates we may arrange your homebound transfer earlier than normal to allow for extra traffic. If this happens, the decision of our overseas staff is final and we will not be liable for any delays or expenses incurred if you choose to make your own transfer arrangements later.</p>
<p>At Geneva we may without notice occasionally, and at no extra cost, for operational reasons substitute rail travel to our Swiss resorts for coach travel.</p>
<p><strong>Private transfer</strong></p>
<p>We offer private taxi transfers for the ultimate speed and convenience for guests booking a full package with flights and accommodation. You can book a private transfer up to 14 days before departure, but we recommend you confirm this at time of booking to ensure it is reserved for you. Prices are shown through our online booking process. If booking after your holiday, please contact us for a quote. Infants must be added as an additional passenger as special arrangements apply.</p>
<p>Please note that some scheduled flights have compulsory private transfers; these are shown in the travel sections on resort introduction pages. Stretch limousine transfers are available for transfers to Whistler in Canada. Private transfer prices will be displayed during the online booking process or contact us for a quote. </p>
<p><strong>Swiss rail transfers</strong></p>
<p>If you are travelling on a scheduled flight to Switzerland via Zurich (and some scheduled flights to Geneva), your transfer to resort is by the efficient Swiss rail system. Second Class rail is included in the price of your holiday. You can upgrade to First Class at a supplement. </p>
<p>If you are travelling to Switzerland via Geneva, transfers are by coach on all charter and some low cost and scheduled flights. You may be able to upgrade your transfer from coach to rail, subject to flight timings, for a supplement. </p>
<p>For all travel by Swiss Rail, children under 16 years receive the Family Card. We regret that no amendments or additions to Swiss rail arrangements can be accepted within 14 days of departure. </p>
<p><strong>Car hire</strong></p>
<p>Hire a car and gain the freedom and flexibility to make the most of your resort and explore your holiday region at your own pace! </p>
<p>Working with partners including Avis, Alamo, Europcar, Sixt, Hertz, National, Thrifty and Budget, Holiday Autos offers competitively priced car hire and a high level of service for all its customers. Cars can be rented at all our arrival airports for the duration of your holiday and also available in some of our major resorts as well enabling you to hire for shorter periods, to explore the local area and perhaps ski further afield. </p>
<p>Booking your car hire is easy just choose the pick-up point, dates and car you require from the selection shown for an instant quote. You can choose the insurance package that is right for you and select any extras such as baby seats, snow chains, etc. </p>
