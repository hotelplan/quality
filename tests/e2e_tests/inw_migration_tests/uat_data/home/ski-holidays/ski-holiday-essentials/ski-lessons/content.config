<h2>Why have ski lessons?</h2>
<a name="01"></a>
<p>Even professional winter athletes have ski lessons (they call it training), so there’s nothing to be ashamed about when a ski instructor leads you down the piste. Inghams have been skiing for over 80 years, and even we have a tune-up with the instructor every so often! Improving your technique is a rewarding experience. We work with a range of excellent ski schools, all with English speaking instructors. No matter which ski resort you’re heading too, you know you can learn in confidence.</p>
<p>We don’t just offer ski lessons either. <a data-udi="umb://document/0458e01672924430a4773adb5301be6b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0458e01672924430a4773adb5301be6b}" title="Insider’s Guides: Where are the best resorts for snowboarding"><strong>Snowboarding</strong></a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/9dc6a6fe70fb4ec4ab3e1eec8316020d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/9dc6a6fe70fb4ec4ab3e1eec8316020d}" title="Cross Country Ski Holidays"><strong>cross-country skiing</strong></a> are both available to pre-book in selected ski resorts, and specialist instruction, such as off-piste ski lessons may be available locally.</p>

<h2>Beginner ski lessons</h2>
<a name="02"></a>
<p>If this is your first ever skiing or snowboarding holiday, we strongly recommend pre-booking lessons. Ski lessons are important for first time skiers, it ensures you are using the correct technique on the mountain, and will be fantastic for your confidence. You will be surprised how quickly you progress.</p>
<p>We've created <strong style="color: #023761;">Learn to Ski Packs</strong> for selected ski resorts, which include everything you need as a first-time skier: lift pass*, skis, ski boots, and ski lessons. Designed for complete beginners, Learn to Ski Packs take the stress out of making sure you have everything you need for your first-ever ski holiday. *Lift pass not included in all resorts, as you may not need it from day one (Please purchase locally on advice of your instructor).</p>
<p><strong style="color: #023761;">Beginner ski holiday top tips</strong></p>
<p>The challenge of knowing when and where to go on your very first ski trip can be a scary and daunting one, but we have put together a few little useful tips to consider before booking your holiday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going outside of the peak weeks (Christmas, New Year, February half term and Easter), as the slopes are less crowded and prices are generally lower.</li>
<li>Choose the right resort - the best resorts for beginners are those with a good selection of nursery slopes and blue pistes - often blues with a bit more of a gradient are better to learn to board. Check out our <a data-udi="umb://document/f9cbab1899084e4cbc69cff979572a9d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f9cbab1899084e4cbc69cff979572a9d}" title="Insider’s Guide: Best ski resorts for beginners"><strong>beginners guide</strong></a> for suggestions.</li>
<li>Book professional ski or board lessons in advance so you learn the right techniques from the start. It will get you off to a flying start and progressing correctly</li>
<li>Hire rather than buy skis and boots. Buying your own kit can be an expensive, especially when you're just starting out. Hire equipment is an affordable solution and you can change your kit in resort if it doesn't suit you. It will also give you more knowledge of the equipment you like when you choose to buy your own.</li>
