<p><strong>Great food and wine, fantastic, friendly service, unbeatable locations and a warm welcoming atmosphere.</strong></p>
<p>An Inghams Xtra Chalet is essentially a stepping stone between a 'normal' chalet and the full services of a <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/accommodation-options/chalet-hotel">Chalet Hotel</a>. Each include a few welcome little 'Xtras' to enhance your chalet holiday, including a full residents' bar run by our own Inghams bar staff and an extra choice at dinner – choose between dessert and cheese for your third course to round off each evening's dining.</p>
<p>Rustic, traditional, comfortable and luxurious; a ski chalet really is the only place to stay on your next ski holiday. All have FREE Wi-Fi, many have log fires, saunas or hot-tubs, and in all of them you will be well looked after by your welcoming Inghams Chalet Host(s).</p>

<p><span class="geolocation-title"> <strong>What to Expect from your Inghams Xtra Chalet Experience</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Our Xtra Chalet Staff</strong></p>
<p>We are frequently told by guests that <strong>‘The Inghams team made our holiday!’</strong> – a compliment we are determined to live up to. Our Chalet Hosts are all enthusiastic dinner-party cooks, who look forward to providing you the warm welcome, delicious food and friendly service which lie at the heart of an Inghams chalet holiday. Most are also avid skiers or snowboarders, and love nothing more than to share their knowledge and passion for the slopes with our guests. Our larger chalets have a professional Chalet Chef to cook for you, with Chalet Assistants helping to serve all meals and look after the chalet’s house-keeping duties.</p>
<p> <br /><strong>Our Xtra Chalet Meals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continental breakfast for 7 mornings with hot options provided by our staff on 6 day</li>
<li>6 days of afternoon tea with cake &amp; savoury treats with tea/coffee</li>
<li>6 days glass of Prosecco before dinner</li>
<li>6 days of 3 course evening set menu with unlimited wine, red, white and rosé to enjoy during your meal.</li>
<li>Vegetarian meal available <span>(request at time of booking)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />Vegetarian options</strong> <strong>are always available</strong>, and other special diets are available at a supplement if booked in advance. <span class="s1">Our Xtra Chalet Hosts will discuss your dietary requirements with you upon arrival to the Xtra Chalet.</span></p>
<p><strong>Christmas &amp; New Year Celebrations</strong></p>
<p>Join us for a proper ‘White Christmas’ in the Alps! All our chalets have a Christmas tree and most have log fires, so combined with great food, good company, and no cooking or washing up, there’s no better place to be! We serve turkey with all the trimmings on Christmas Day, with a pre-dinner glass of Champagne, mince pies and Christmas pudding to follow crackers.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, all our chalets and Chalet Hotels serve a special Celebration Menu, preceded by a glass of Champagne. After dinner join the resort festivities, generally with fireworks to see in the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All our chalets are completely non-smoking properties </strong></li>
<li><strong>Chalet ratings</strong> shown for each property are our own ratings, and not to be confused or compared with any system of official ‘star’ ratings or hotel categories.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Children aged <strong>11 years and over</strong> are welcome in all chalets on all dates.</li>
