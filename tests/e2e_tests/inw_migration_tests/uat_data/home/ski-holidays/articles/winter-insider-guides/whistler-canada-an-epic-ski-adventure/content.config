<p>Whistler lift passes are now hands-free via a mobile app called My Epic app combine this with over 8,000 acres of skiable terrain and a summit of 2,285 metres - skiing in Whistler is almost unbeatable.</p>

<h3>Merging of the Mountains - Whistler Blackcomb:</h3>
<p>The combined mountains of <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Whistler Blackcomb</a> (which before 1997, were 2 separate ski areas but are now combined with the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/activities/peak-to-peak-gondola/" target="_blank" title="Peak 2 Peak">Peak 2 Peak gondola</a>) ensures there is ample skiing and snowboarding for everyone of all abilities. The Jersey Cream chairlift got an update in time for the 2024/25 ski season - offering more up load capacity, from a 4 person to a 6 person lift.</p>
<p>Due to its proximity to backcountry areas, not only can adventurers explore the 200+ designated trails and slopes, but also the untouched powder areas, steep chutes and remote alpine terrain.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/6d336d627fb34bec960e3b7bc041f7e1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6d336d627fb34bec960e3b7bc041f7e1}" target="_blank" title="Ski Holidays for Beginners">Skiing in Whistler for beginners</a> is especially good, and has the locally acclaimed blue run: Harmony Ridge - a well groomed, easy run with the most amazing views, going slower is a pleasure on this ski slope. Another firm favourite is the Peak to Creek blue run. At 11km long, this is one of the longest consistent runs in North America, and is accessible for all skiers.</p>
<p>The resort also boasts 17% beginner terrain, perfect for those starting out their adventure on the snow, great for improvers. If you’re feeling confident, you can make your way up the Village Gondola or over to the Olympic Station for the calmest part of the mountain with green runs and marked slow zones for those hoping to improve their skills.</p>
<p>Not to forget those thrill-seekers, <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/aee42e5bfb084fa984ce50ac300330fb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/aee42e5bfb084fa984ce50ac300330fb}" target="_blank" title="Skiing for Advanced">looking to challenge themselves</a> in the great outdoors, Whistler offers 28% advanced terrain, so there is never a dull moment. </p>
<p>If you are an avid <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/13cca02f7ef4467cade8c8e89e68fe39" href="/{localLink:umb://document/13cca02f7ef4467cade8c8e89e68fe39}" target="_blank" title="Snowboarding Holidays">snowboarder</a>, you are certainly not forgotten here - with freestyle and terrain parks that include kickers, rails and boxes, they welcome you to join in.</p>
<h3>When to ski in Whistler:</h3>
<p>Whistler has one of the longest seasons in North America, from <a data-udi="umb://document/2819c143bbf84221b5e0a691e8b36bca" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2819c143bbf84221b5e0a691e8b36bca}" title="November skiing">November</a> to May.

<h3>Canada ski holidays - more than Maple Syrup:</h3>
<p><a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/e8889d8c0e844cde8208727a22b5dfd3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e8889d8c0e844cde8208727a22b5dfd3}" target="_blank" title="Canada">Canada</a> is known for Maple syrup, however, there is so much more to experience and try when it comes to food and drink, especially in Whistler.</p>
<p>There are a few highlights that are worth noting, one being Canada's version of a Bloody Mary for those <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/89595b9898014c5fbd93f5619c64b079" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89595b9898014c5fbd93f5619c64b079}" target="_blank" title="Apres Ski Holidays">après ski</a> lovers - a Caesar, which is made with ‘clamato’ juice, instead of your standard tomato juice - that’s clams and tomatoes combined, giving the drink an extra kick. They then usually add a pickled bean or gherkin and sometimes even a bit of beef jerky for a special twist. </p>
<p>This local tipple is also one of <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.aircanada.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" title="Air Canada">Air Canada’s</a> popular in-flight drinks to serve when in-bound to Whistler, it's worth asking the flight attendant for the recipe to re-make this Canadian classic at home. </p>
<p>Whilst in Whistler, The Mallard Lounge at the <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/9dff430bb4aa43bc987c0ce4f4d5b3f3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/9dff430bb4aa43bc987c0ce4f4d5b3f3}" target="_blank" title="Fairmont Chateau Whistler">Fairmont Chateau Whistler</a> serves a fantastic Caesar. It offers brilliant up-market après, with live entertainment nearly every day and they make an amazing cocktail to have around the firepits that back out onto the slopes. Even if you’re not staying at the hotel, it’s a must to ski down to the base of Blackcomb Mountain, clip off your skis and enjoy a bit of posh après.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a drink that is perhaps more comforting and less alcoholic, then look no further than one of Whistler’s newer cafes based in Creekside - <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2022/12/27/new-creekside/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Rockit Coffee Co</a>, with cool and retro décor and signage, it's a place to warm up with a good coffee or hot chocolate. </p>
<p>If you have a sweet tooth and need something to accompany your hot chocolate, then you will need to visit <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2020/03/10/whistler-blackcomb-dining-options/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Crystal Hut</a>, a mountain dining option that serves the best waffles across Whistler resort. There are many toppings to choose from here too, but this time we are in support of some maple syrup.</p>
<p>Back down in the resort, you may want to try the Canadian delicacy of <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2012/03/29/mountain-meals-whistler-loves-poutine/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">poutine</a> - essentially chips, cheese curds and gravy. There are also some truly wonderful restaurants to dine in. With the resort offering a vibrant culinary scene and hosting some acclaimed chefs who create fantastic dishes with local ingredients, there are many restaurants to try. Fine dining with elegant yet friendly atmospheres include places such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/dining/dining-guide/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Rim Rock Café &amp; Oyster Bar or The Grill Room</a>.</p>

<h3>Past the piste - holidays to Canada:</h3>
<p>The village centre is a home from home, with cosy cafes, alpine architecture and little boutique stores, it’s a lovely place to spend some time when you’re not out on the slopes.</p>
<p>There are so many more activities available here, whether you’re in the need of <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/b4c9b6c332ba475d8d2f9f940dba4d46" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b4c9b6c332ba475d8d2f9f940dba4d46}" target="_blank" title="Ski &amp; Spa Holidays">relaxation</a>, some après fun or a bit of a shopping spree.</p>
<p><strong>Good for thrill seekers -</strong> feel free and fly through the sky at exciting heights by giving <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/activities/zipline/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Ziptrek</a> a go, a zip-line tour around Whistlers forests and creaks.</p>
<p><strong>Good for those looking to relax -</strong> the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/wellness/scandinave-spa/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Scandinave Spa</a> is where you can really unwind, this is a hidden thermal spa surrounded by the local forest with the mountain peaks in the background. With thermal water, hydrotherapy pools and massages, these open-air baths are an ideal escape from everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Good for adventurers -</strong> Take the day at your own pace with a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/activities/snowshoeing/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Snowshoe tour</a> and follow trails deep into the forest to see snow-covered old growth trees and wildlife. Either find your own path or enjoy local knowledge on a guided tour.</p>
<p><strong>Good for après lovers -</strong> And it really is easy to find an après bar in Whistler, they cater for every kind of atmosphere. From fancy, classic, sport to dance bars - you will find the place (and drink) for you.</p>
<p>For an extra special experience, try <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2011/10/25/cold-chillin-the-belvedere-ice-room/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">the Grey Goose Ice Room at The Bearfoot Bistro</a> where the room is covered wall to ceiling in ice and you need an extra warm coat to visit. With 55 different vodkas to try in super chilled glasses, this part-castle, part-igloo will transport you to a Narnia-esq world.</p>
<p><strong>Good for alpine dining -</strong> Skiing is a very hunger-inducing sport, so good, filling food is a big part of anyone's winter holiday. Luckily Whistler can cater to all your culinary desires.</p>
<p>From slope-side cafes, such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/blog/post/2020/03/10/whistler-blackcomb-dining-options/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Ravens Nest</a> which serves awesome non-meat dishes that are packed with flavour and offer a wide-range of dishes. If dining at its finest with lots of choice included is your ideal scenario, then try one of the resort's <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/dining/whistler-tasting-tours/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Tasting Tours</a> to sample the best local restaurants - from hunter gather platters, salmon tartare, vegetable risotto and seasonal desserts - it will tick every box for food lovers.</p>
<p>After a day of skiing and then a night of dancing, you may be in need of some chips or a burger and Whistler hasn’t dismissed this late night craving. With many evening restaurants, such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/dining/dining-guide/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">21 Steps</a> offering generous portions at modest prices late into the night.</p>
<p><strong>Good for evening outings -</strong> If you want to spend some quality time together and organise a romantic gesture, then why not take your loved one ice skating? Visit the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/activities/ice-skating/" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism">Whistler Olympic Plaza</a> at night time to skate under the twinkling lights.</p>
<p><strong>Good for family fun -</strong> Go all out and visit <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.whistler.com/business-directory/business/?id=3950" target="_blank" title="Whistler Tourism" data-anchor="?id=3950">Vallea Lumina</a> - the most epic snowball fight you will ever have. Imagine paintballing, but with perfectly pre-made snowballs.</p>
<p><strong>Good for the planet</strong> - 90% of British Columbia's (where Whistler is situated) power is generated via hydroelectricity. One of the these individual hydroelectricity projects powers the entire ski mountain area. </p>
