  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Our Reps in Italy tried and tested the longest ski run in Cervinia recently in preparation for our guests arrival. The ski run is approx. 22km and starts from Plateau Rosa and finishes at Valtournenche, a village south of Cervinia. The conditions were excellent – there were blue skies, fresh white snow and cruising red runs, perfect for the intermediate skier. The longest run in Cervinia can take around 3 hours if you want to blast down with no stops. Alternatively, if you want to relax and take in the scenery, there are a number of pit stops along the way, making it a wonderful day out.</p>
<p>Here are some snaps of what they got up to on their ski trip….</p>
<p>Once you exit the cable car Laghi Cime Bianche-Plateau Rosa , be prepared for some breathtaking views across the tops of the mountains. Here’s the top of Plateau Rosa Cable Car – early morning.</p>
<p>A snap of the stunning Matterhorn once you get to the top. One half of the mountain dominates the skies of Cervinia and the other overlooks the stunning village of Zermatt in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Ready to go over the edge down red 7! It’s a little chilly but the Reps have their windproof Inghams uniform to keep them warm! Here’s Neil our Resort Manager looking pensive but ready to go!!</p>
<p>It was a fantastic day with perfect conditions, and just right to take the odd snap of the pistes. This view is at the top of 35 and 36, which eventually links to the last part of red run 1, and all the way down to Valtournenche.</p>
<p>A great place for lunch is at Willy’s Bar! It’s one of the most popular ski refuge bars on the way down to the end of the runs. Here’s Teodora in Cervinia getting a big bear hug!</p>
<p>The typical Italian mountain snack consists of Parma ham, a fatty ham called “lardo,” which is supposed to keep you warm for those long ski days, and of course some local cheese all washed down with a glass of Italian white wine.</p>
<p>Getting ready before they hit the last leg down to Valtournenche…</p>
<p>Once you’re down in the village of Valtournenche, there are plenty of places to refuel before you head to Colle Cime Bianche, where you can connect back to the bottom of red 7 and cruise back down to Cervinia.</p>
<p>If you have booked to go to Cervinia try this ski run at least once during your stay and if you haven’t then I recommend you add it to your wish list! Wishing you all a wonderful ski holiday!</p>
