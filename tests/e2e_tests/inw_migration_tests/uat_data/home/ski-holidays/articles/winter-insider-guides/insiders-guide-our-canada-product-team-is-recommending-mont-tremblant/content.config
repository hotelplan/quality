<p><img src="/media/13077162/30613877344_58bcb7b135_k.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/a48c84d8fa4141ecb22011067ce4f415" /></p>
<p>This resort is the ideal spot for a family adventure in <a data-udi="umb://document/e8889d8c0e844cde8208727a22b5dfd3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e8889d8c0e844cde8208727a22b5dfd3}" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<h4>1. The main reason for your visit - what's Skiing and Snowboarding like? </h4>
<p><img src="/media/13055264/tremblant.jpg" alt="Canada - ski and snowboard" data-udi="umb://media/299be29726614484b654580def890267" /></p>
<p>As you ski or snowboard, you are surrounded by forests and lakes. The resort offers 96 trails in total and it is a great place for beginners and intermediates, so perfect for a <a data-udi="umb://document/a543e1407c404a978d9b4539252fc875" href="/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/a543e1407c404a978d9b4539252fc875%7D" title="Family Ski Holidays">family activity holiday</a>. If you are a family of ski pros though, fear not - Tremblant also has some challenging double-black diamond runs and amazing off-piste trails hidden amongst the trees. Whenever there is fresh powder, the woods are full of excited local skiers &amp; boarders, so you know you're in the best place at this resort. </p>
<h4>2. What about Tremblant itself - what kind of area is it? </h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077157/tremblant-slope-to-town-canada.jpg" alt="Canada town life" data-udi="umb://media/49338151c978473989487874764554ed" /></p>
<p>Not only has Mont Tremblant been named the number one ski resort in Eastern North America, but it does also offer so much more. This family friendly resort with its pedestrian village, cobblestone lanes and colorful buildings, offers plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes - and most importantly, a very safe, welcoming and charming approach to its yearly tourists. </p>
<h4>3. Everyone appreciates a bit of culture - is the area of Quebec hospitality and cultured?</h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077158/bloginghcamt201702252328.jpg" alt="Canada Culture" data-udi="umb://media/cb8187118f1643fa887aaf72f72c28b5" /></p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/cc094a7f49b04e9a845adc78e3c77f10" href="/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/cc094a7f49b04e9a845adc78e3c77f10%7D" title="Mont Tremblant">Quebec</a> itself (this is the area of Mont Tremblant) has a culture that is a mix of North American with a French influence. The native language is French, and English is only spoken as a second language here. Whilst on your <a data-udi="umb://document/a543e1407c404a978d9b4539252fc875" href="/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/a543e1407c404a978d9b4539252fc875%7D" title="Family Ski Holidays">Canadian family holiday</a> here, you must treat you and your children to the local delights (which would please any child), such as La Sugar Shack, maple syrup cooled on snow, or La Poutine, French fries with gravy and cheesy toppings.</p>
<h4>4. Winter or not, this is an outdoor holiday - what's there to see? </h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077720/12173485763_6eabe0de9d_k.jpg" alt="Canada nature" data-udi="umb://media/b4ba86f6832846468aaccc8ab411ff7a" /></p>
<p>It is all about nature here! Mont Tremblant is an excellent place for nature lovers as the resort is surrounded by many lakes and endless forests. Deer are very friendly here, so much so that the locals often feed them by hand - They prefer carrots and apples if you would also like to feed them. </p>
<h4>5. A fulfilling holiday experience is important, what other activities are there?</h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077721/24903866803_311741f599_k.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/101c4181fc9d442284f5c056f217ac11" /></p>
<p>There is so much more to try than skiing and snowboarding - Mont Tremblant is a paradise for <a data-udi="umb://document/9dc6a6fe70fb4ec4ab3e1eec8316020d" href="/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/9dc6a6fe70fb4ec4ab3e1eec8316020d%7D" title="Cross Country Ski Holidays">cross-country skiers</a> and snowshoeing, especially in the Laurentian National Parc, which is only a couple of miles away from the resort. It is a must do activity for anyone visiting Tremblant, as it’s simply the best way to soak up the beauty of the local countryside and see the surrounding wildlife. </p>
<p>There are plenty of unique winter activities to participate in here, from winter mountain biking, snowshoe fondue tours, dog sledding, helicopter rides, horse sledding, snowmobiling, ice climbing and ice fishing…there is literally something for everyone to enjoy!</p>
<h4>6. Let’s not discount Nightlife - how can an evening be spent? </h4>
<p><img src="/media/13075439/270019.jpeg" alt="canada nightlife" data-udi="umb://media/74cd55e0a3ab496a97002f9145a83eab" /></p>
<p>Now you might have chosen a week without the children, or perhaps decided to get a babysit for an evening - either way, you will want to explore the nightlife. The resort has a vibrant nightlife and <a data-udi="umb://document/5021d925acef42a8b6f45a429a5212f8" href="/%7BlocalLink:umb://document/5021d925acef42a8b6f45a429a5212f8%7D" title="Insider's Guide: Top 5 Apres Ski Drinks">après ski scene</a>. The most popular clubs and bars are the P’tit Caribou and the Central Tapas. Before heading to a nightclub, everyone stops by at the local microbrewery – La Diable, aka The Devil!</p>
<h4>7. Time of year to visit is important - are there Events &amp; Festivals?</h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077163/30943739953_778853e1d9_k.jpg" alt="Canada - festival" data-udi="umb://media/fd755142721a4a2aa17d6b9d82358727" /></p>
<p>The resort hosts many exciting events and festivals throughout the winter. The National Alpine Championship is held in March and attracts Canada’s best alpine skiers who compete for the title of National Champion in various Alpine sports. Among famous festivals are the Rando Touring festival and 24 hours Tremblant.</p>
<h4>8. It’s Canada! - so why go there you ask? </h4>
<p><img src="/media/13077164/30765364524_455c49b81b_k.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/52eee503ae9c4a41a785b03ccc941a96" /></p>
<p>Why would you not? A home away from home but on a vast and beautiful scale - snow like you’ve never seen it before, settled on mountains like no others. Everyone (like their reputation) is so welcoming and friendly, and the landscape is just amazing -  I believe you will have fun and enjoy it here as much as I do!</p>
