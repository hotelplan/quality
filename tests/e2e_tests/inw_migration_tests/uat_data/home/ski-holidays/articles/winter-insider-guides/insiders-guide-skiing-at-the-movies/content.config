<strong>Location: <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/arlberg-ski-area/lech">Lech, Austria<br /></a></strong><br />One of the UK’s most famous romantic comedies, Bridget is invited to go to luxurious <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/arlberg-ski-area/lech">Lech</a> by her boyfriend Mark Darcy for their first holiday together. Bridget – not having skied before – is left on her own on the slopes and – due to the shock of thinking she might be pregnant – proceeds to recklessly tear down the piste, inadvertently gate-crashing an official slalom event (and beating the participating skiers). The scene ends with her skiing into a pharmacy in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/arlberg-ski-area/lech">Lech’s</a> centre and struggling with the language barrier when requesting a pregnancy test.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong>

<strong>Location: Breckenridge, USA</strong><br /><br />This classic comedy involving Jim Carrey sees the two dim-witted main characters attempting to deliver a briefcase to a woman in Aspen. The briefcase contained money left on purpose for her husband’s kidnappers, but Harry and Lloyd think they can help by returning the briefcase. There is a particularly funny scene where Harry licks an ice cold pole on a chair lift and becomes stuck to the lift! The film had a lot of filming done in Breckenridge.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/articles/winter-insiders-guides/insiders-guide-skiing-at-the-movies#top" title="Top1">^ Return to the top </a></div>

After an all-night party in the hot tub, the men wake up in 1986. Before realising this, the four set out for a day on the slopes, encountering people wearing fluorescent one-piece ski suits and individual leg warmers. The group eventually realise what has happened when they see a man with a jerry curl haircut and are told that Michael Jackson is still black in a very amusing comedy in one of <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/canada">Canada’s</a> best resorts.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:<br /></strong>It would be remiss of us not to recommend a lodge with a hot tub in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/canada/fernie">Fernie</a>!

<strong>Location: <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/arlberg-ski-area/st-anton">St Anton, Austria</a></strong> <br /><br />Another British romcom, Chalet Girl showed us the lifestyle of a high-end chalet worker in the illustrious resort of <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria/arlberg-ski-area/st-anton">St Anton</a> in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/austria">Austria</a>. Main character, Kim, has never skied or been to the Alps before and so – in amongst waiting on glamorous guests – she learns to snowboard. After an initial struggle to learn, she finds she can transfer much of the talent from her skateboarding days, enters a snowboarding competition and ends up winning the event and the prize money of £25,000.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:<br /></strong>Any fan of Chalet Girl, surely needs to stay in a chalet?

Skiing at the movies, wouldn’t be complete without a nod to Britain’s favourite spy on skis, James Bond! Since his first appearance on the slopes, James Bond has always had a link with skiing. Here’s some of the history of Bond's skiing hijinks.<br /><br /></div>

<strong>Location: <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/graubunden-ski-region/st-moritz">St Moritz, Switzerland</a></strong><br /><br />Likely the most iconic and impressive of Bond’s ski scenes. Bond, in his bright yellow snowsuit has to escape his Soviet attackers by skiing through the glorious off piste of <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/graubunden-ski-region/st-moritz">St Moritz</a>. He kills one with his pole/gun and evades the others by launching himself off a cliff (this part was filmed in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/canada">Canada</a>), only to unfurl the famous Union Jack parachute. The scene lives long in the memory of many and the cliff jump scene blew everyone away - a piece of stunting history.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/articles/winter-insiders-guides/insiders-guide-skiing-at-the-movies#top" title="Top1">^ Return to the top </a></div>

<strong>Location: <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/murren">Murren, Switzerland</a></strong><br /><br />This 1969 epic sees George Lazenby’s first and last foray into the James Bond world and features multiple ski scenes. Most of the film is based atop <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/murren">Murren’s</a> Schilthorn Mountain in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland">Switzerland</a>, which neighbours <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/wengen">Wengen</a> and <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/grindelwald">Grindelwald</a> which is used as Blofeld’s headquarters. There are a few ski scenes, including one of Blofeld’s associates getting churned up by a piste-basher and Bond skiing away from baddies on one ski! Rumour has it, ski legend Jean Claude Killy doubled as Bond for the ski scenes shot in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/zermatt">Zermatt </a>and <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/saas-fee">Saas Fee</a>, showing Bond's prestige.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:<br /></strong>The 4* <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/murren/hotel-eiger">Hotel Eiger</a> in <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/jungfrau-ski-region/murren">Murren</a> is less than 10 minutes’ walk from the Schilthorn lifts. It also boasts superb views of the mountains and great facilities including indoor pool, Jacuzzi and sauna. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/articles/winter-insiders-guides/insiders-guide-skiing-at-the-movies#top" title="Top1">^ Return to the top </a></div>

When his snowmobile is shot at by a helicopter, Bond is forced to abandon it before it explodes. One of the blades from the snowmobile lands next to him and he fashions it into a snowboard, escaping the bad guys by skating across a lake where their skis cannot get them across. This groundbreaking scene was filmed on a glacier bordering <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/italy">Italy</a>, right by <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/graubunden-ski-region/st-moritz">St Moritz</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:<br /></strong>The <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/switzerland/graubunden-ski-region/st-moritz/hotel-monopol">Art Boutique Hotel Monopol</a> is somewhere you can imagine Mr Bond sauntering through.

He manages to force one to crash by skiing through trees, clothes-lining him with a pole between two tree trunks, and the other after a chase down a bobsleigh run, enabling his getaway.
<p><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong> <br />Stay in the centre of the famous Corso Italia at the <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/italy/the-dolomites-ski-area/cortina-d-ampezzo/chalet-hotel-parc-victoria">Chalet Hotel Parc Victoria</a> and you won’t be disappointed.

He manages to make two crash into trees and uses a cliff jump to slash his ski through the parachute of one, making it crash into the other in mid-air. Bond then uses his protective bubble to shield him and Electra from a mini avalanche caused by the crashing snowmobiles before they escape.
<p><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong> <br />Sit back and relax in a quiet location with views towards the magnificent Mont Blanc at our <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/france/chamonix/chalet-hotel-sapini%C3%A8re">Chalet Hotel Sapiniere</a>.
