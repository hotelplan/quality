<p>From perfectly groomed pistes to mountain restaurants serving mouth-watering food,<a data-udi="umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902" href="/{localLink:umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902}" title="Italy"> Italy</a> is the choice destination for connoisseurs of the ski holiday. </p>
<p>Italy is one of our favourite countries to ski in, and it’s growing in popularity with British skiers who have caught onto the many charms of this fantastic nation. We’ve highlighted just five reasons why you should go skiing in Italy – but there are many more.</p>
<h3>Amazing Scenery</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13062743/italy_the-dolomites-ski-area_skiers-action-mountains2.jpg" alt="Is skiing in Italy good" data-udi="umb://media/b5a1f05ab5824df69ffa001e3009da49" /></p>
<p>We happen to think that Italy is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. The picture-postcard scenery of the <a data-udi="umb://document/47c7f0773b104efb87f3357e7314f393" href="/{localLink:umb://document/47c7f0773b104efb87f3357e7314f393}" title="The Dolomites Ski Area">Dolomites</a> is unquestionably distinctive, especially as the rock glows pink at sunrise or in the evening light. The jagged, Alpine peaks are instantly recognisable and provide a strikingly dramatic backdrop to stylish ski resorts such as <a data-udi="umb://document/2dcb1a3292da421780aa165d449493a9" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2dcb1a3292da421780aa165d449493a9}" title="Cortina D’Ampezzo">Cortina</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/37d9070a8d4e4a609b9c192e453f0f97" href="/{localLink:umb://document/37d9070a8d4e4a609b9c192e453f0f97}" title="Selva">Selva</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/aa3c7a33c713409b8cca203164e09aca" href="/{localLink:umb://document/aa3c7a33c713409b8cca203164e09aca}" title="San Cassiano">San Cassiano</a> (to name just a few).</p>
<p>It’s not just the Dolomites that provide incredible views. The sky-high ski paradise of <a data-udi="umb://document/bfccaf52eb4c47f09ae3657298234fda" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bfccaf52eb4c47f09ae3657298234fda}" title="Cervinia">Cervinia</a> is dominated by Switzerland’s <a data-udi="umb://document/43703d590ae4451faee0e5625182ac02" href="/{localLink:umb://document/43703d590ae4451faee0e5625182ac02}" title="Insider's Guide: The ultimate mountain icons">iconic Matterhorn</a>, and is surrounded by outstandingly beautiful, high altitude terrain. We also can’t resist the gorgeous views from the charming ski resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/e469a37cba1c498e9197c6963def7b89" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e469a37cba1c498e9197c6963def7b89}" title="Livigno">Livigno</a>.</p>
<h3>Delicious Food and Drink</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13062733/italy_the-dolomites-ski-area_dinner-mountain-view.jpg" alt="Is skiing in Italy good" data-udi="umb://media/e575d47660a54b4cac6442c8fd6377c2" /></p>
<p>It’s no secret that Italian food and drink is delicious. You can’t get a more welcoming meal after a day’s skiing than a scrumptious bowl of pasta or a pizza overladen with cheese. And you’ll find first-class restaurants both on and off the mountain. In the Alta Badia region of the Dolomites, they’re so proud of their on-mountain culinary offering you can hire a guide to lead you on a gourmet ski safari.</p>
<p>Italy is of course one of the most popular countries when it comes to their cuisine. Luckily, children always seem to love Italian food - from pizza to pasta, it's always a favourite. The great thing about family meals in Italy, is the locals are so welcoming and friendly and always consider the children - from smaller portions of famous dishes, ‘babyccino’ drinks and the best gelato!</p>
<p>Off the mountain, Alta Badia is still renowned for its gastronomy. The resorts of San Cassiano and <a data-udi="umb://document/f5a15898b6694ef6a1c755346a0e1ba8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f5a15898b6694ef6a1c755346a0e1ba8}" title="Corvara &amp; Colfosco">Corvara</a> are both home to <a data-udi="umb://document/b4c9b6c332ba475d8d2f9f940dba4d46" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b4c9b6c332ba475d8d2f9f940dba4d46}" title="Ski &amp; Spa Holidays">Michelin starred restaurants</a> including La Siriola, which has a dedicated chocolate room! All this sounds incredibly expensive, doesn’t it? But that’s where skiing in Italy really shines – sure, the occasional gourmet restaurant may be pricey but, overall, Italian restaurants are famously great value. Eat well and for less? Yes please.</p>
<h3>Great Value Skiing and Snowboarding</h3>
<p><img src="/media/2257/italy_dolomites.jpg" alt="Is skiing in Italy good" data-udi="umb://media/aa25e87ab1134b47b5f5be14c0ade6ca" /></p>
<p>You get more bang for your buck in Italy. We’ve already mentioned the great value food and drink, but the savings go so much further. <a data-udi="umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902" href="/{localLink:umb://document/996aa9008def4ffe9a331c775cc97902}" title="Italy">Italian ski resorts</a> have typically great value lift passes. Take, for example, the Dolomiti Superski area: a whole area lift pass provides you with access to up to 1,220km of pistes across more than 8 resorts, and there are great savings on child, youth and senior passes.</p>
<p>Situated close to the Italian/Swiss border, the ski resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/e469a37cba1c498e9197c6963def7b89" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e469a37cba1c498e9197c6963def7b89}" title="Livigno">Livigno</a> offers a winning combination of snow-sure skiing and incredible shopping. Owing to a quirk of history, the entire town has a special duty-free status, and shopper-skiers can take advantage of the great prices along Livigno’s bustling high street.</p>
<h3>Fantastic, Fun and Friendly Locals</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13083789/ortisei-streets_2.jpg" alt="Is skiing in Italy good" data-udi="umb://media/5315936e70434ff5a0944a72430fe5ea" /></p>
<p>Italians typically provide visitors with the kind of warm welcome you would normally reserve for friends and family members. Familial and kind-hearted, the laid-back attitude in most Italian ski resorts ensures exceptional service in their hotels, restaurants, and bars.</p>
<p>This friendly atmosphere extends to the lively <a data-udi="umb://document/89595b9898014c5fbd93f5619c64b079" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89595b9898014c5fbd93f5619c64b079}" title="Apres Ski Holidays">après ski</a> scene. No one knows how to have fun quite like the Italians, and the relaxed vibe in the many ski resort bars and clubs is one of the county’s many draws. We love the wild and hedonistic vibe of <a data-udi="umb://document/a0b1d3c577424320a9af2e1af08b6887" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0b1d3c577424320a9af2e1af08b6887}" title="Sauze d'Oulx">Sauze d’Oulx’s</a> après ski scene – one of the best party resorts in the Alps.</p>
<h3>Incredible Hotels</h3>
<p><img src="/media/13072242/adler-dolomiti-ortisei-winter-view.jpg" alt="Is skiing in Italy good" data-udi="umb://media/8764b7ec24074c3b91a10b7a6eeb90b6" /></p>
<p>Italy is home to incredible hotels with distinctive character, exceptional style, and heritage, and, of course, fabulous Italian service with a smile.</p>
<p>Typifying the classic Italian-style hotel is the luxurious, 5* ADLER Spa Resort Dolomiti in Ortisei, Val Gardena. Founded in 1810, the hotel has been family-run for an astonishing seven generations! It is the largest spa hotel in the Dolomites and has gained a reputation as the leading wellness centre in South Tyrol. We’re especially fond of the mountain sauna hut and the blossom steam bath in a grotto.</p>
<p>Stay there this winter and enjoy sampling the selection of over 300 Italian wines, which are stored in the hotel’s private wine cellar. The Adler Cocktail Bar is also the perfect place to enjoy a pre- or post-dinner tipple. With its outstanding service and short distance to the ski lifts, this is one hotel you do not want to miss.</p>
<h2>Top resorts to visit </h2>
<p><img src="/media/2251/italy_canazei.jpg" alt="ItalyResorts" data-udi="umb://media/c8abefa95a92400185dd374b18d40c7b" /></p>
<h3>Champoluc: </h3>
<p>At Inghams, we call Champoluc a hidden gem. With an authentic Italian feel and based in a charming village with a collection of classic accommodation choices, Champoluc is a must visit. Often quieter than some of the more popular resorts, you will find well groomed slopes, lifts with little to no queues and a lift pass that covers Champoluc, Gressoney and Alagna. With plenty to do on and off the slopes, it's the perfect place to explore.</p>
<p>Take a break from skiing for the day but still enjoy all the fresh snow and great snowy pathways that surround Champoluc. Try some Snowshoeing, a fun and popular winter activity that is considered a slightly more relaxed approach to snow sports. Pack yourself a picnic and head out by yourselves or on a guided tour for a day of exploration.</p>
<p>Quality time to spend with your friends on holiday is all part of the experience. Add a bit of competition to the mix and try Champolucs Driving Park with karts on ice. Challenge your friends to a race around the ice track, situated in the middle of the Aosta Valley natural park.</p>
<p>Champolouc has a great outdoor playpark, a perfect way to enjoy some fresh air and build up your appetite (or perhaps lead up to nap time). It’s got everything you would expect from a park, and a bit more - with spectacular treehouses and gentle walks through the forest on snow-cleared paths. http://www.parcoavventurachampoluc.com/</p>
<h3>Plan de Crones </h3>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent ski school for kids</li>
<li>Attractive, snow-sure ski area</li>
<li>Lots of fun ski activities to enjoy</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugely popular with families, the ski resort of Plan de Corones (more commonly known as Kronplatz) in Italy has a great snow record due to the high altitude and snow making facilities covering almost every inch of the piste. Italy is a fantastic country to bring the kids to ski. Italians are typically very friendly towards children, and most restaurants and cafés are welcoming of families and Kronplatz is no exception. Part of the breath-taking Dolomites ski area, Kronplatz is an undiscovered gem, with only a small percentage of its annual tourists being British – a perfect secret ski spot to avoid those heavy crowds in February half term.</p>
<p>The dominating feature of the ski area is the large Kronplatz Mountain. From the large plateau at its summit, skiers have a 360° panoramic view of the surrounding “pale peaks” of the Dolomites. Beginners and intermediates will be spoilt for choice, with blue and red runs making up almost 85% of the area. The average run length is 5km, making Kronplatz ideal for skiers looking to build on their confidence and endurance (and leg muscles). More ambitious skiers can take on the “Kronplatz Black 5”, which includes the Piculin run, one of the steepest runs in Italy, with a gradient of 72% over its 2km length. 32 state-of-the-art lifts serve the 119km of pistes in Kronplatz itself, and those looking to venture further afield can take a 20 minute bus ride to Alta Badia, from which they can connect to the enormous Sellaronda circuit.</p>
<p>As you explore the ski area, be sure to head towards the beautiful tree-lined skiing over on the Percha side. This is a great place to grab a few snaps on the camera before taking the Reid gondola back up to the Kronplatz summit and skiing down to St Vigil, where you can be mesmerised by the sun setting while enjoy a well-earned drink on one of the many bar terraces.</p>
<p>The excellent children’s lessons in Kronplatz are led by the brilliant instructors of Scuola Sci. The boys and gals in their blue ski suits will have the kids up and running in no time, not just getting to grips with the basics but working on good technique to ensure positive progression throughout the week as well as ensuring the kids are having fun, after all that is the most important thing while on holiday. The adventure world in Little Kronplatz helps even the youngest in the family find their ski legs, and once they are ready, they can take on the Kronplatz treasure hunt.</p>
<p>For Mum and Dad: If mum and dad can get an afternoon off there are loads of great shops in the resort to as well as a few spas if you just need some peace and quiet. If, however you need an adrenaline rush just for adults, we highly recommend the sledding, para gliding or tandem flights, all guaranteed to get you buzzing.</p>
<p>Family fun: Outside of skiing there’s a massive range of fun activities for all the family to enjoy including dogsledding, ice-skating, ninepin bowling or for something more cultural, you can even visit the museums at the Kronplatz summit.</p>
