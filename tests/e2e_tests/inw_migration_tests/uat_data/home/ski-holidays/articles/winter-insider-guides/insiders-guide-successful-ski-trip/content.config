<h2>Ski clothes: </h2>
<p><img src="/media/13094509/mg_5650_freeride_ws2021_stubai_maxdraeger_medres.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/b5ced990f04746f8b156eb26081e41a7" /></p>
<p>No matter how snazzy your jacket and salopettes are, the key to the most effective ski outfit is lots of layers. Whether you’re lucky enough to be out on a blue bird day or are getting covered in snowfall, this way you can layer up or down throughout the day depending on how hot or cold you are feeling. </p>
<p>There are so many brands now that offer ski and snowboarding clothing - it’s hard to always know what to buy, what the quality may be or if the value is fair. </p>
<p>The best way, be it to keep up with fashion or to keep growing children wrapped up each year, is to consider renting your ski gear. This new way of sourcing your ski outfit makes ski clothing affordable due to the great value offered when renting, means you can stay fashionable as you can select items for that seasons must have look and it is also better for the planet, by limiting fast fashion.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a rel="noopener" href="https://ecoski.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="EcoSki">EcoSki</a>, the ski clothing rental company, offer all of this and use of eco-friendly cleaning, reusable and recyclable packaging and the ability to repair many of the items they offer and it is such an easy process to do so.</p>

<p>‘EcoSki is excited to be able to offer its customers the option of skiwear rental. This market has seen huge growth this past year and we're so proud to have been at the forefront of this change. </p>
<p>It's such an obvious way for families to access high quality warm clothing without the hassle of cleaning, storage and of course the large price tag.'</p>

<h2>Ski boots: </h2>
<p><img src="/media/13072305/snow_rock_insidersguide_geararticle_boots.jpg" alt="skiboots" data-udi="umb://media/ac63b7d8ff7a4ddab1b87b4d77e6af78" /></p>
<p>If you decide that you want to purchase your own boots instead of renting, it’s important to understand the different types of ski boots available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpine (downhill) boots - They have a hard plastic shell which is intended to hold the foot and ankle securely in place; the more your ski ability increases, the stiffer you’ll want your boots, to accommodate the extra power going through them and transitioning this power straight to the ski edges</li>
<li>Touring boots - these differ from alpine boots in that they can switch between two modes: skiing and touring. In touring mode, the cuffs loosen and allow a more natural stride for skiers who like to venture off-piste and need to hike up mountains before skiing down</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing is there are plenty of experts to help you out on what the right boot is for you and can even visit stores for a boot fitting.</p>
<p>The first thing your boot fit technician will do is conduct a full analysis of your foot profile and your gait. This will include your measurements, whether your feet pronate or supinate (roll inwards or outwards while walking) and whether your arches and insteps are low or high. </p>
<p>Your foot profile will help your technician to help you select the right technical socks. These are important because ski socks and boots work together to keep you comfortable and warm on the slopes. Once you have your socks, the technician will bring you pairs of ski boots to try on with them to ensure you have the right combination and the right volume.</p>
<p>The volume of a ski boot refers to how tightly or loosely it is designed to fit. Low volume ski boots, the narrowest fit, are often favoured by those with slim feet or advanced skiers for the precise translation of movement between the foot and the ski. High-volume boots are more accommodating for wider feet, whilst mid-volume boots combine the foot hold of low volume with a more relaxed fit to suit most regular foot types and feel comfortable all day.</p>

<h2>Helmets and Skis:</h2>
<p><img src="/media/13050665/helmets.jpg" alt="skihelmet" data-udi="umb://media/47192ba769d342dc9864fb47876e4fbd" /></p>
<p>The great thing about well established ski resorts is that they have great on-site shops for hiring ski and snowboarding equipment. This is perfect if you want to try out different styles, such as short skis or if you are new to skiing and are not ready to commit to the purchase of a helmet. </p>
<p>Either way, seeking professional guidance can ensure you have the best quality equipment and the right equipment for your needs. </p>
<p>There are many types of skis from snowblade, freestyle to carving so speaking to an expert in store is always a good idea if you are a little unsure or want to try something new. Making sure you have the right skis for you will mean your skiing experience will be easier and more enjoyable. The same can be said for Snowboards - you want to ensure your board is the right weight and length for you. </p>
<p>Helmets are considered a must have out on the mountains, and it is vital that you buy or hire a helmet to fit you securely. They massively reduce the risk of head injury and due to the growing popularity of them, you can find some pretty cool colours, patterns and motifs on helmets these days. </p>
