<p>The round or star shaped piece of plastic on the bottom of your ski pole.</p>
<p><strong>Berm:</strong></p>
<p>A bank of snow (or sometimes much higher) that builds up along the edges of the pistes. Berms act as outline for the skiable area, protect you from going off the piste and also provide some fun to practise your freestyle tricks off.</p>

<p>What you clip your ski boots into that holds them to the skis or snowboard.</p>
<p><strong>Black:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cornice:</strong></p>
<p>An overhang of snow that can be seen on roofs, tips of mountains, edges of the piste. Caused by high winds whipping fresh snow into interesting shapes. These snow features can be more hassle than they are worth, however, large ones can break off and cause avalanches.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as Nordic Skiing and classically different from downhill <a href="#Alpski">Alpine Skiing</a>. Cross-Country skiing features special skis where the heel is not attached to the ski so that you can ‘walk’ across long distances aided by poles.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic stance:</strong></p>
<p>With the terrain constantly changing on the mountain it’s important to adopt your dynamic stance- knees bent and flexible, placed slightly apart, in line with your hips, head raised and eyes focused on the area in front of you. This stance helps you to maintain your balance as you travel along.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13051293/e_esf.png" alt="E Esf" width="840" height="202" rel="840,202" /></p>

<p><strong>Gnarly:</strong></p>
<p>A word for something that is over the top extreme, radical, dangerous and/or perfect. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts. i.e that was an awesome ski run, so steep and Gnarly/his cut on his hand was really gnarly!</p>
<p><strong>Gnar:</strong></p>
<p>A shortened version of Gnarly, meaning high on the scale of ‘cool’ or ‘radness’. GNAR is actually an acronym for Gaffney’s Numerical Assessment of Radness, a game invented by the late Shane McConkey and Robb Gaffney at Squaw Valley Resort. The game is simple; you get GNAR points for doing cool stuff. Skiers quickly adapted this game in order to push themselves, get one up on each other and just have fun whilst making idiots of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Gondola:</strong></p>
<p>See: Quick guide to lifts and modes of transport (coming soon!)</p>
<p><strong>Green:</strong></p>
<p>See: Quick guide to piste and slope classification (coming soon!)</p>
<p><strong>Grooming:</strong></p>
<p>Most resorts will ‘groom’ the slopes after the lights go off. This is usually done with a tractor at night time combing/ploughing out the snow on the slopes that gets messy during the day so that they are smooth and fresh in the morning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="page-title"><img src="/media/13051299/h_heliskiing.png" alt="H Heliskiing" width="840" height="200" rel="840,200" /></span></p>

<p><span class="page-title">M</span><br /><strong>Magic Carpet:</strong></p>
<p><span>A conveyor-belt surface lift (like the ones found in airport terminals) usually found at the nursery slopes to help beginner skiers up the slope.</span></p>

<p>Another slang name for snow. This refers to wet and heavy snow that can be quite difficult to ski on.</p>
<p><strong>Merging:</strong></p>

<p>Humps and bumps carved into the snow, typically created by many skiers skiing over an area and whipping up the snow into these characteristic bumps, but sometimes they are deliberately created by piste groomers. Once at an intermediate level, navigating the mogul field can be great fun.</p>

<p><strong>Pow Pow:</strong></p>
<p>Pronounced “paow paow”. Pow Pow is the slang term for the crème de la crème of skiing, fresh POWDER. Fine, dry, fluffy and lightweight; powder is the Holy Grail for snow sport enthusiasts. Large amounts of fresh snow make for epic conditions and give you the feeling of ‘floating’ on the surface. BUT be careful as there are few things in this world more challenging than the art of getting up in powder once you have fallen over!</p>
<p><strong>Powder:</strong></p>
<p>Fresh, untouched snow that can be very deep and very soft! Great fun to ski in if you have the right equipment and level of ability.</p>
<p><strong>Powder skis:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rail: </strong></p>
<p>A bar, usually metal like hand railings you get by stairs, but positioned in such a way that skiers and snowboarders can slide, or 'grind', up and down it. Most exclusively found in a <a href="#terrainpark"><strong>t</strong></a><strong><a href="#terrainpark">errain park</a>.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Ski brake:</strong></p>
<p>Small spokes that stick out of the bottom of your skis when they are not attached to your boots to stop the loose ski from sliding away from you when you are trying to clip them on or they come unclipped following a fall.</p>
<p><strong>Ski Bum:</strong></p>
<p>A seasonaire who is lucky enough to not need a job during the ski season. This obviously means plenty of riding time on the slopes but you will need plenty of money to do so! Fingers crossed for that winning lottery ticket!</p>

<p><strong>Steezy/Steez:</strong></p>
<p>The term has been coined by Snowboarders and combines the word ‘style’ with ‘ease’. If a trick is done in a smooth, cool and clean fashion it could be described as being steezy or that the rider landed the trick with steez. A rider’s clothing (normally the baggier the better) can also be described in the same fashion if they are looking particularly cool or ‘gangsta’.</p>

<p>See: <a href="#park">Park</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tracked out:</strong></p>
<p>When a fresh snow area has been over ridden and there are no fresh lines available.</p>
<p><strong>Traverse:</strong></p>
<p>Arguably the safest way to descend a steep slope- skiing in traverse fashion is typically zig-zagging your way down a piece of steep terrain as opposed to going straight down. This allows you to control your speed.</p>
<p><strong>Tubing:</strong></p>
<p>A fun sport that involves sitting in a large rubber ‘doughnut’ ring that has a smooth bottom and sliding down the slope. Much alike sledging but faster and there are often dedicated tubing slopes so you can go as fast as you like within a controlled environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="page-title"><img src="/media/13051311/w_whiteout.png" alt="W Whiteout" width="840" height="200" rel="840,200" /></span></p>

<p>Snow that has been compressed by the movement of the wind. </p>
<p><strong>Wind hold: </strong></p>
