The wide Proclou run down to Super-Morzine is especially good run for beginners. You can easily get a gondola back up rather than continuing across to Morzine. Le Lil Stash beginners snow park runs alongside, if you start feeling courageous enough to try a jump by the end of the week.</p>

<p><em><strong>Base station</strong></em>: Many resorts have a ‘base station’, which is the main gathering area at the village level where the lowest chair lifts will serve the skiing areas up the mountain.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chair lift</em></strong>: Quite literally what the name says! Chair lifts vary in size and speed, small 2-person chair lifts might serve the gentler areas of the slope, whereas large 8-person chair lifts will whisk lots of skiers and boarders up the mountain quickly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gondola</em></strong>: Fundamentally an enclosed, mini-cabin lift that fits anywhere between 4-8 passengers. Generally much faster than an open chair lift.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lift pass</strong></em>: Your ticket to access the resort and lifts! These days they sometimes come in the form of a waterproof tag that you have attached to the outside of your clothing, or a contactless card that can be worn inside your glove or sleeve that you simply ‘swipe’ on the barriers to get through. To read more about the different types of lift pass, please check out our other Insider’s Guide: Learn the Lingo: A-Z Glossary of ski slang and trail talk.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nursery Slopes</strong></em>: Not to be associated with the idea that these are slopes for children only, nursery slopes are gentle slopes allocated to beginners only. Usually out of the way of the passing through ski traffic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parallel turns</em></strong>: A technique of skiing that you will be taught during your lessons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Piste</em></strong>: ‘Piste’ is the French word for a ski run (pronounced like ‘least’). In Europe they are referred to as ‘pistes’, whereas in USA and Canada they prefer the terms slope, trail, run.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ski bus</strong></em>: A bus that runs very regularly around the resort and exclusive for skiers and boarders who hold lift passes. You can be picked up from any of the numerous pick up points and dropped at the main base station.</p>
