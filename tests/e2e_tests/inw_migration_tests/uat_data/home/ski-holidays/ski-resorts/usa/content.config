  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sooner or later many British skiers are tempted to try America simply out of curiosity, and Wyoming’s <a href="/{localLink:f736cf43-bd2e-4ddf-974c-2138d3c3fe6d}" title="Jackson Hole">Jackson Hole</a> and Colorado's <a href="/{localLink:8690}" title="Breckenridge">Breckenridge</a> are <a href="/{localLink:8689}" title="USA">American</a> ski classics, offering some of the finest slopes in the Rockies. Jackson has a well-earned reputation as something of a cult resort for its steeps and deeps, though it has plenty of more modest slopes too. Breckenridge has long been a firm favourite with British skiers, and is opening up a big new off-piste area in one of the biggest terrain expansions in Colorado for some years.  Both resorts have an excellent snow record: when it comes to American ski holidays, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming powder are hard to beat!</p>
<p>They do things a little differently on the slopes in the USA. The skiing in America may be adrenalin-charged, but the way the chairlifts and gondolas are loaded is much more peaceful and polite than in Europe! There’s no pushing, shoving or barging as you line up to ride the lifts – and certainly no-one tramples all over the backs of your skis. This is achieved by lift-attendants who good naturedly orchestrate the loading arrangements. Skiers and boarders feeding into a lift will alternate while the attendant matches up groups of two or three with single skiers, so that, for example, a group of three will be joined by a “single” and make up a four. As you reach the lift you’ll find handy boxes of Kleenex you can dip into if your exertions in the powder have brought on a sniff or a snuffle! The Americans are also very keen on safety: there’s plenty of off-piste (or ungroomed runs) but if a run says it’s closed – it means just that. Ducking under a rope can easily mean you’ll have your lift pass confiscated. The word backcountry generally means leaving the ski area boundary – but usually it also means exiting through special gates, not just wherever you please. American ski patrollers are friendly but firm, and won’t hesitate to stop you speeding in family areas or cutting under a rope. Eating and drinking on the mountain is a little different too: the Americans don’t really go in for lingering European style lunches. Alcohol tends to be frowned on in USA ski resorts, so you may feel uncomfortable if you normally have a few glasses of wine with lunch. In the Rockies the actual food tends be seen more as a functional pit stop to refuel rather than an event in its own right, and restaurants at ski resorts in North America are usually king-sized self-service cafeterias. But both “Breck” and Jackson do have more sophisticated table service restaurants too. Sevens is a smart table-service restaurant at the Peak 7 base in Breckenridge. And Jackson Hole’s top mountain eatery is the <strong>Couloir Restaurant (named after the resort’s infamous Corbet’s Couloir) at the top of the Bridger Gondola at 9,095 ft. </strong> This fine dining restaurant has superb views through floor-to-ceiling windows across the valley floor.  Breckenridge has four ski mountains (rather unimaginatively named Peaks 7, 8, 9 and 10) – about to be five, with the planned opening this winter of 543 acres of new terrain in the Peak 6 area. The project will include 400 acres of lift-served slopes and 143 acres of “hike-to” terrain. In Jackson Hole, a new electronic gate system should get skiers and boarders onto the slopes faster. Guests will be able to purchase reusable “J Card” tickets that contain an integrated RFID (Radio Frequency ID) tag which will open the lift access gate automatically. This will speed up the loading process because the lift attendant won’t need to check your pass. Work has started on the construction of a new chairlift which will be installed in the summer of 2015 - ready to celebrate Jackson Hole Mountain Resort’s 50<sup>th</sup> season. Recently the resort spent nearly $6 million improving intermediate skiing with the installation of the Casper high-speed detachable quad and associated trail work. </p>]]></description>
