<p>Experience the Arctic landscape and meet the locals on this adventurous itinerary, based in <strong>Narvik</strong>, bringing you a host of unique and memorable experiences to explore this undiscovered area of Norway. For the duration of your tour, you’ll be based in your chosen hotel in Narvik one Northern Norway’s most important harbour towns, located at the mouth of the impressive Ofotfjord.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each day you’ll venture out into the surrounding ‘winter wonderland’ landscape on our exclusive excursions, all included in the price of your holiday. You’re bound to make, and photograph, memories you’ll never forget. Everything has been planned for you, so let us take care of all the arrangements so you can focus on enjoying the scenery and making the most of your holiday!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Norway’s mainland coast in Troms county, north of the Arctic Circle and close to the Swedish border, the harbour town of Narvik is surrounded by stunning natural scenery, including the ‘Skjomtind’ mountain, named ‘The Sleeping Queen’ after Queen Victoria! Narvik is also home to 6,000 year old rock carvings, a vibrant shopping area, and several museums documenting the town’s turbulent history. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What our guests say... </strong></p>
<p><em>"Every single element of the holiday was absolutely top class. We couldn’t have asked for a better, more attentive representative from Inghams and the hotel and activities exceeded my expectations. Everything was well organised, well planned and well executed. I absolutely loved every minute of it. Thank you Inghams." </em>Mrs. A. Casey, 6 March 2016</p>
<p><em>"The whole holiday has been a wonderful experience, and our rep Katja made it even better. Well done - we had a fantastic time!" </em>Mrs. E. Williams, February 2016</p>
<p><em>"It has been amazing, we've really enjoyed our trip and are looking forward to coming to Norway again. Overall so much fun - thank you Inghams for helping us create memories" </em>Ms. S. Tiplady, February 2016</p>
<p><em>"An excellent well-organised short break and a complete contrast to summer or winter beach holidays for non-skiers such as ourselves. The dog-sledding was amazing and will stay with me for a long time!" </em> Mr. R. Hull, February 2016</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dining</p>
<p>Daily breakfast, lunch and evening meals are also all included in our tour prices. Evening meals will be taken at your hotel in Narvik, but those staying 4 nights will also enjoy a unique Sami dinner around an open fire at the Fjellkysten camp.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>DAY 1 | ARRIVAL &amp; NORTHERN LIGHTS ADVENTURE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="white_box_shadow">
<p>Your Inghams Representative will welcome you at Evenes Airport and take you by coach (approx. 45 minutes journey) to your chosen hotel in Narvik  – choose from either the <a href="/{localLink:42626d81-8952-4fb1-9c58-c6813cdde95a}" title="Quality Hotel Narvik"><strong>Quality Hotel Narvik</strong></a> or <strong><a href="/{localLink:c99fb48b-c1e7-41e4-bb2d-422466953aa1}" title="Hotel Scandic">Hotel Scandic </a></strong>.  After settling in, join us for an orientation walk around Narvik to get to know your ‘home town’ from the outset, including the town centre harbour and museums. <br /><br />Following dinner, we set off by coach on a guided tour into the wilderness above <a href="/{localLink:6bac1f94-656b-426d-ac42-04aa84f12878}" title="Narvik"><strong>Narvik</strong></a>, in search of the spectacular <a data-udi="umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271" href="/{localLink:umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271}" title="Northern Lights"><strong>Northern Lights</strong></a>.  Our experienced guide knows all the best spots, where minimal light pollution gives the best possible chance to see these amazing coloured lights, dancing in waves and ripples across the night sky, and being directly under the Aurora Borealis belt is said to improve your chances to seeing the Northern Lights natural phenomenon!</p>
<p><strong>DAY 2 | <strong>POLAR WILDLIFE PARK</strong></strong></p>
<p>After breakfast, a scenic coach journey takes you to the <strong>Polar Wildlife Park</strong>, the northernmost such park in the world, and home to many native species, including <strong>wolves</strong>, <strong>arctic foxes</strong>, <strong>lynx</strong>,  <strong>reindeer</strong> and <strong>moose</strong>. One of the park’s rangers will take you on a tour of the park to meet the animals, who have plenty of space in their enclosures of natural habitat. For those of you who are a bit more daring (18yrs+ only), you can book to <strong>go into the enclosure with the wolves</strong> and a chance to get a ‘wolf-kiss’ from these curious creatures (pre-book from £119). These wolves have been brought up in the park and are used to human contact and you’ll be fully briefed and accompanied by an expert handler throughout.  This is a truly unique experience you cannot do anywhere else in the world and definitely one you’ll never forget!</p>
<p>A buffet lunch in fantastic surroundings at the park is included, before our return ‘home’ to Narvik.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 3 |  ‘POLAR EXPRESS’ SCENIC TRAIN &amp; SNOW ACTIVITIES IN SWEDISH LAPLAND</strong></p>
<p>After breakfast, there’s a fantastic day-trip to the Swedish border, starting on the famous <strong>‘Polar Express’ train</strong>, known locally as the Ofotbanen railway.  Departing from Narvik this scenic train winds its way along the <strong>Ofotbanen Railway</strong> through glistening snow-covered landscapes and along the Ofotfjord, before reaching <strong>Abisko</strong>, across the border in Swedish Lapland (approx. 1hr 30 minutes journey). Often described as one of the most spectacular railway lines in the world, this is a stunning journey through a unique landscape, as you go from deep fjords and steep mountains to snow-covered wilderness.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052850/dx3m45.jpg" alt="Polar -express narrow" width="599" height="286" rel="840,401" /></p>
<p>The railway is key to Narvik’s history.  After the native nomadic Sami people discovered one of the world’s richest deposits of iron ore in <strong>Swedish Lapland</strong> over 250 years ago, the railway was constructed in 1902 as an alternative to the more traditional mode of transport (reindeer!) to bring the ore inland and to the coast, and giving Narvik its significance as a key port in the Northern Europe. <span>This journey on Europe’s northernmost railway is regularly rated as one of the world’s most scenic rail-trips, so be sure to bring your camera!</span></p>
<p>At Abisko you’ll disembark to enjoy some <strong>snow activities</strong> such as a <strong>free husky-sledding experience</strong>, free snowshoe hike around Abisko's mountains and frozen lake, learn how to ice-fish, or take a short <strong>snowmobiling safari </strong>(18yrs+ only, pre-book from £35 per person sharing. please note guests must have a valid driving license).  A buffet lunch is included for a taste of this wonderful area, before heading back to Narvik by coach.  Dinner tonight is taken at your hotel.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, guests may choose to stay in Abisko into the evening for dinner and <strong>Northern Lights watching</strong>, heading back to Narvik by coach at approx. 10:30pm (pre-book from £39 per person).  You may also book an hour's <strong>photography course</strong> to learn how to take the best Northern Lights images to take home (pre-book from £39).</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 (for 3 night breaks Sun-Weds) | RETURN TO UK</strong></p>
<p>Guests on our 3-night adventure have the morning at leisure before the coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4 (for 4-night breaks Weds-Sun) | WAR MUSEUM, NARVIK MOUNTAIN &amp; SAMI CAMP DINNER </strong></p>
<p>This morning we’ll explore Narvik, steeped in military history and Norway’s major deep-water port. Narvik has a strong wartime history and our guided tour includes a visit to the brand new War Museum and guided bus tour before we head up by gondola to Narvik mountain. <br /><br />You’ll also visit <strong>Narvik Mountain</strong>, known locally as ‘Narvikfjellet’ accessible by gondola from the town centre.  Sometimes described as the ‘top of the world’, the mountain is used by the locals for skiing, but also enjoys <strong>spectacular views over the town, harbour, fjord and surrounding mountains.</strong> You will have a chance to go tobogganing, or even skiing if the spirit of adventure takes you before a buffet lunch in the Narvikfjellet mountain restaurant is also included.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052804/sami-reindeer.jpg" alt="Sami -reindeer" width="859" height="347" rel="859,347" /><br /><br />To round off this final day, we take an evening trip to a traditional Sami camp and its ‘Lavvu’ tent at nearby Fjellkysten, right on the fjordside. Here you will enjoy a <strong>traditional Sami dinner</strong> around the open fire, meet the <strong>reindeer</strong> and try your hand at the art of lassoing! The evening provides another chance to see the spectacular Northern Lights, in a different, more secluded, fjordside setting to your first evening on the Narvik Safari, as the lights reflect across the still waters of the fjord. We hope this traditional campfire experience perfect finale to your Northern Norway holiday.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 5 (for 4-night breaks Weds-Sun) | RETURN TO UK</strong></p>
<p>Guests on our 4-night adventure have the morning at leisure before the coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
