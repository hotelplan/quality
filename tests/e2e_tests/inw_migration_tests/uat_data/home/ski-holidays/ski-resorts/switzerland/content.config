  <description><![CDATA[<p>Switzerland is known to be full of life’s finer things - cheese, chocolate, great wine, high end shopping, gorgeous restaurants – and of course skiing. With some of the best terrain for skiing, snowboarding and snow activities, it's easy to see why Inghams customers return year after year. Lot's of Swiss resorts are traffic-free making them peaceful and incredibly scenic. The Swiss Alps appear higher, more dramatic and more spectacular than other ski areas in Europe. We guarantee major highlights from your stay in Switzerland will be the queue-free lifts, high altitude snow and wide uncrowded runs. Unlike newer ski villages, Swiss resorts are authentic and the mountain restaurants, friendly cafes and Victorian-style hotels will make you feel like you’re experiencing true Swiss culture.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/b6b86190431e4d00b8c3d1ff789ee0b9" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b6b86190431e4d00b8c3d1ff789ee0b9}" title="Switzerland" class="c-btn">View all Switzerland ski deals</a></p>
<h2>Where to ski in Switzerland</h2>
<h3>Snow in Switzerland</h3>
<p>Even without its iconic Matterhorn, Zermatt is be one of the world’s top ski resorts, offering prime conditions for skiing and snowboarding thanks to its high altitude of 3,820m. The resort also benefits from its natural perimeter of glaciers making snow conditions close to, if not, perfect. Zermatt is able to prep and maintain slopes throughout the season due to its investment in ‘The Snow-Maker’, an artificial snow machine.</p>
<h3>Best for Families</h3>
<p>If your idea of a family holiday involves gliding along gentle ski slopes and soaking up unforgettable scenery then let us introduce you to Wengen. Making up the Jungfrau ski region with Grindelwald and Mürren, this Swiss resort offers slopes for all ability levels, as well as a range of off slope activities, perfect for those of you looking to share your passion of winter sports with your children. The resort is small but benefits from a traffic free system and you’ll find lots of the accommodation available here is family run.</p>
<h3>Best for Groups</h3>
<p>Davos will provide you and your group with the joys and opportunities of six whole mountains to explore. Ranging from blue right through to black slopes, Davos provides over 250km of runs able to suit you regardless of your experience. Davos also benefits from an excellent cable car system enabling you to access all mountains with ease.</p>
<p>If group skiing trips are a regular for you, then Mürren is a must. Suited towards the slightly more experienced crowd you’ll struggle to choose between the array of red and black runs or the Skyline snow park that will give you a challenge. You’ll also benefit from the ski in ski out access across selected accommodation, allowing you to ski right to your door.</p>
<h3>Best for Après</h3>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1}" title="Zermatt">Zermatt</a>, being one of the top ski resorts of the world, offers skiers and snowboarders a vast and inviting range of après activities, ranging from stalls with live music, laid back piano bars and lively nightclubs operating into the early hours of the morning. If energetic après after a daring ski run is your forte then you’ll be right at home in Zermatt – partying with a view of the famous Matterhorn never gets old.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55}" title="St. Moritz">St Moritz</a> offers a more scenic and sophisticated après-scene. You’ll experience a more traditional Swiss atmosphere, but that’s not to say the drinks don’t flow… because they do. The King’s Club in Badrutt’s Palace Hotel is the most well-known nightclub and hosts events by famous DJs from around the world!</p>
<h3><strong>Best for Beginners</strong></h3>
<p>Plenty of British ski schools are available throughout Switzerland, especially in <a data-udi="umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50}" title="Saas Fee">Saas Fee</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/f6cb1f0178b7447488bbf36b5f109fbc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f6cb1f0178b7447488bbf36b5f109fbc}" title="Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a>. Both private and group tuition are available from fluent English speaking instructors. Saas Fee has some of the most snow sure nursery slopes and they are separated from the rest of the ski area, meaning you can learn at your own pace. Over 30% of Grindelwald’s slopes are classed as ‘easy’ so you can test out your new skills in different terrains.</p>
<h3>Best for Snowboarders</h3>
<p>Completing the <a data-udi="umb://document/f71942fdfeb0473ea01087403d83b724" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f71942fdfeb0473ea01087403d83b724}" title="Graubunden Ski Region">Graubünden Ski Region</a> alongside Davos and St moritz<span>, </span><a data-udi="umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0}" title="Klosters">Klosters</a> accommodates for the snowboarders.

Yet in spite of being relatively small (16,000 square miles), Switzerland is so famous for its mountains, predominantly in the southern half of the country, that there are “Little Switzerlands” all over the world: from North Carolina and the Drakensbergs of South Africa to Luxembourg and even Folkestone, Kent! The iconic Matterhorn too has “lookalikes” in many mountain ranges.</p>
