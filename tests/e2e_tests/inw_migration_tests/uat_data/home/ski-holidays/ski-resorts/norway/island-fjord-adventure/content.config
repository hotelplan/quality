<p>You’ll visit a traditional <strong>‘Sami’ camp</strong>, where you’ll learn about much of the culture of the Sami people and their traditional, simple way of life.  Traditionally nomadic people, ancient folklore and legend play a strong part in the Sami people’s history, who believed the <strong>Northern Lights</strong> were a phenomenon caused by the energy of their ancestor’s souls flying across the sky!  At the camp, you’ll cosy up by the campfire of a traditional ‘Lavvu’ tent with a warming drink and story-telling as well as venturing outside of course to admiring the night sky.  Try an ‘Aurora Cocktail’, served in an ice glass, with some tasty traditional Sami snack.</p>

<p><img src="/media/13052844/01-rib-sea-safari-from-harstad.jpg" alt="Rib tour" width="859" height="341" /></p>
<p>After breakfast, you’ll set off on an exciting <strong>RIB boat</strong> sea safari onto the 46km-long <strong>Vågsfjorden</strong>, surrounded by one of Norway’s most scenic island archipelagos.

Created by locally renowned chefs, Sigrid Rafaelsen and Kim Håvard Larsen, and served in a roof-top setting with spectacular views, this promises to be a very tasty and memorable experience.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 3 | HURTIGRUTEN CRUISE TO SENJA ISLAND</h2>
<p>Following breakfast, you’ll board one of the famous <strong>Hurtigruten ships</strong> for a relaxing 3-hour scenic cruise along the Vågsfjorden and north to the town of Finnsnes, passing the unique Norwegian scenery of snow-covered mountains protruding from the rich, dark blue waters of the fjords. </p>
<p>From Finnsnes, you’ll embark a coach tour on the spectacular island of Senja, following the coast on the famous National Tourist Route, recognised for its natural beauty. There will be photo-stops along the way at the Ersfjord and Tungesnet viewpoints, both accessible, as well as a break for an included lunch in the pretty, traditional fishing village of Hamn i Senja, with its panoramic Atlantic Ocean views, before returning to Finnsnes to catch the ‘express’ boat back to Harstad (approx. 90 minutes).

<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 3-night breaks Sun-Weds) | RETURN TO UK</h2>
<p>Guests on our 3-night adventure have the morning at leisure, before the coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 4-night breaks Weds-Sun) | ‘HISTORIC HARSTAD’ TOUR &amp; RØKENES FARM FEAST</h2>
<p>You’ll take an historic tour of Harstad, including the amazing World War ll ‘Adolf Gun’, one of the world's largest land-based guns. Still located inside a military base, you are only able to visit the gun with our guide, who will explain the detailed and interesting history of the gun and the role the gun played during the war for the German army, and Harstad’s history as an ally to the British. Inside, the gun looks exactly like it could have done when it was left in 1945 with original machines and plenty of artefacts still in place.  You can even climb into the 46cm diameter barrel of the gun for a unique photo opportunity!</p>
<p>You will also visit the picturesque Trondenes Church, a tall white building, which has been on the edge of the Vågsfjorden for over 750yrs since 1250. Now a protected building, a visit inside to see the beautiful and richly-decorated interior, which reflects the church’s journey through time, is only possible with our guide.</p>
<p>Your final morning stop is Røkenes Manor and Farm, owned by ten generations of the Kulseng family since 1673, and now renowned for its culinary traditions. Enjoy a tour of the estate and a delicious buffet lunch.  The tour gives you insights and tales from its history, with a peak inside the historic building, originally a family home. Then the former cowshed - now a delightful banqueting hall - sets the scene for a memorable lunch feast, with a buffet of fresh local specialities.  After a leisurely lunch we head back to Harstad, for some free time to relax, or to treat yourself to a little shopping for souvenirs of this memorable trip before your transfer to the airport for your flight home.</p>
