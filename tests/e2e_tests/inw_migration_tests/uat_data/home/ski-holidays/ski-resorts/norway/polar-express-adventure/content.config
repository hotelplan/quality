<div class="white_box_shadow">
<p>Your Inghams Representative will welcome you at Evenes Airport and take you by coach (approx. 45 minutes journey) to your chosen hotel in Narvik  – choose from either the <a data-udi="umb://document/79ea0382d4fe4481912b0f596b84ed3e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/79ea0382d4fe4481912b0f596b84ed3e}" title="Quality Hotel Narvik"><strong>Quality Hotel Narvik</strong></a> or <strong><a data-udi="umb://document/0f81e0e90be042c4a9074b3abc35a1ee" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0f81e0e90be042c4a9074b3abc35a1ee}" title="Scandic Hotel">Hotel Scandic (formerly Rica)</a></strong>.  After settling in, join us for an orientation walk around Narvik to get to know your ‘home town’ from the outset, including the town centre harbour and museums. <br /><br />Following dinner, we set off by coach on a guided tour into the wilderness above <a data-udi="umb://document/229b219729a54801a3d3e6affe22b40b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/229b219729a54801a3d3e6affe22b40b}" title="Narvik - Polar Express Adventure"><strong>Narvik</strong></a>, in search of the spectacular <a data-udi="umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271" href="/{localLink:umb://document/280ef861622541caa4a7e53db8f83271}" title="Northern Lights"><strong>Northern Lights</strong></a>.  Our experienced guide knows all the best spots, where minimal light pollution gives the best possible chance to see these amazing coloured lights, dancing in waves and ripples across the night sky, and being directly under the Aurora Borealis belt is said to improve your chances to seeing the Northern Lights natural phenomenon!</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 2 | ‘POLAR EXPRESS’ SCENIC TRAIN &amp; SWEDISH LAPLAND</h2>
<p>After breakfast, there’s a fantastic day-trip to the Swedish border, starting on the famous <strong>‘Polar Express’ train</strong>, known locally as the Ofotbanen railway.  Departing from Narvik this scenic train winds its way along the <strong>Ofotbanen Railway</strong> through glistening snow-covered landscapes and along the Ofotfjord, before reaching <strong>Riksgränsen</strong>, just across the border in Swedish Lapland (approx. 50 minutes journey). Often described as one of the most spectacular railway lines in the world, this is a stunning journey through a unique landscape, as you go from deep fjords and steep mountains to snow-covered wilderness.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052850/dx3m45.jpg" alt="Polar -express narrow" width="859" height="442" /></p>
<p>The railway is key to Narvik’s history.  After the native nomadic Sami people discovered one of the world’s richest deposits of iron ore in Swedish Lapland over 250 years ago, the railway was constructed in 1902 as an alternative to the more traditional mode of transport (reindeer!) to bring the ore inland and to the coast, and giving Narvik its significance as a key port in the Northern Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Riksgränsen you’ll disembark to enjoy an array of <strong>snow activities</strong> such as a <strong>free 2 hour husky-sledding experience</strong>, plus <strong>snowmobiling</strong>, <strong>alpine skiing</strong>, <strong>a guided winter hike</strong>, or a <strong>tour of Riksgränsen</strong> (payable locally). An Arctic buffet lunch is included for a taste of this wonderful area, before boarding the train back to Narvik.  This journey on Europe’s northernmost railway is regularly rated as one of the world’s most scenic rail-trips, so be sure to bring your camera!</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 3 | <strong>POLAR WILDLIFE PARK</strong></h2>
<p>After breakfast, a scenic coach journey takes you to the <strong>Polar Wildlife Park</strong>, the northernmost such park in the world, and home to many native species, including <strong>wolves</strong>, <strong>arctic foxes</strong>, <strong>lynx</strong>, <strong>wolverines</strong>, <strong>reindeer</strong> and <strong>moose</strong>.  One of the park’s rangers will take you on a tour of the park to meet the animals, who have plenty of space in their enclosures of natural habitat.  For a small local supplement (approx. £16), expert handlers will take you into the Arctic fox enclosure, to see these beautiful and characterful creatures up close.  For those of you who are a bit more daring (18yrs+ only), you can book to go into the enclosure with the wolves and a chance to get a ‘wolf-kiss’ from these curious creatures. These wolves have been brought up in the park and are used to human contact and you’ll be fully briefed and accompanied by an expert handler throughout.  This is a truly unique experience you cannot do anywhere else in the world and definitely one you’ll never forget!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A buffet lunch in fantastic surroundings at the park is included, before our return ‘home’ to Narvik.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 3-night breaks Sun-Weds) | RETURN TO UK</h2>
<p>Guests on our 3-night adventure have the morning at leisure before the coach leaves for Evenes Airport and your homebound flight.</p>
<h2 class="geolocation-title location-text">DAY 4 (for 4-night breaks Weds-Sun) | NARVIK &amp; SAMI EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>This morning you’ll explore Narvik, steeped in military history and Norway’s major deep-water port. Narvik has a strong wartime history and after a guided tour, we visit the famous <strong>Narvik Centre</strong> and the <strong>Red Cross War Museum</strong>, to learn about the famous 1940 <strong>Battle of Narvik</strong>, which involved Norwegian, French, Polish and British forces, including notably, the Royal Navy.<br /><br />You’ll also visit <strong>Narvik Mountain</strong>, known locally as ‘Narvikfjellet’ accessible by gondola from the town centre.  Sometimes described as the ‘top of the world’, the mountain is used by the locals for skiing, but also enjoys spectacular views over the town, harbour, fjord and surrounding mountains. You will have a chance to go tobogganing, or even skiing if the spirit of adventure takes you before a buffet lunch in the Narvikfjellet mountain restaurant is also included.</p>
<p><img src="/media/13052804/sami-reindeer.jpg" alt="Sami -reindeer" width="859" height="347" rel="859,347" /><br /><br />To round off this final day, we take an evening trip to a traditional Sami camp and its ‘Lavvu’ tent at nearby Fjellkysten, right on the fjordside. Here you will enjoy a <strong>traditional Sami dinner</strong> around the open fire, meet the <strong>reindeer</strong> and try your hand at the art of lassoing! The evening provides another chance to see the spectacular Northern Lights, in a different, more secluded setting to your first evening on the Narvik Safari, as the lights reflect across the still waters of the fjord. We hope this traditional campfire experience perfect finale to your Northern Norway holiday.</p>
