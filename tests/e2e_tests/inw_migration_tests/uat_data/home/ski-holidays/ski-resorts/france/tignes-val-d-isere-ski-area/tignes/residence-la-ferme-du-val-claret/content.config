  <description><![CDATA[<p>Located in the heart of Tignes Val Claret, these welcoming apartments are the perfect base for your ski holiday. The warm décor and perfect location provide you with a home away from home for your week in the mountains.</p>
<h2>Ski-in, ski-out</h2>
<p>The apartments are located in the high altitude resort of Tignes, located in the ski area of <a data-udi="umb://document/3f107aa9435442a892636b72e6e40b03" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3f107aa9435442a892636b72e6e40b03}" title="Tignes-Val d’Isere Ski Area">Espace Tignes -Val d'Isere</a>, which has exceptional snow coverage throughout the whole season. With the piste located right on your doorstep, you'll be able to make first lifts with ease. The ski lifts and ski school meeting areas are located opposite the building, just a couple of minutes away, so you can pop your skis on at the door and head out straight after breakfast.</p>
<h2>Spa facilities</h2>
<p>During your stay, you'll have access to some fantastic spa facilities in the Spa O des Cimes located in Le Nevada and Le Telemark buildings. These are only a short walk from the apartments, so you'll be able to take a moment to relax once you've returned from a long day on the slopes. Make the most of the indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, hot tub and steam room available - or if you'd really like to treat yourself, why not book in and have a massage or beauty treatment.</p>
<h2>Spacious alpine apartments</h2>
<p>The residence is split across two traditional chalet buildings. Each apartment is finished to a high standard and creates the perfect alpine feel. Ideal for family and small groups of friends, each apartments offers spacious communal areas and cosy bedrooms. You're in for a treat, as the residence offers some great views of either the village or the ski slopes, so you can appreciate the scenery all day.</p>
