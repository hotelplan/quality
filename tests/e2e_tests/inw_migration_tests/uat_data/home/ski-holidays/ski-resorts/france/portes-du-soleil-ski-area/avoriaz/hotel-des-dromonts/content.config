<h2>Flashback to the 1960s</h2>
<p><span>As soon as you enter the hotel, you are plunged into the world of the 1960s. </span> It is a contemporary work of architecture, the building's "fan-shaped" design offers a panoramic views of the surrounding mountain peaks. The hotel had been designed by Jacques Labro who imagined it as a playground for big kids. The warm and cosy hotel has bright colours a retro designed furniture to take you straight back to the 60s,  the décor of the rooms follows the theme too, with cedar wood work, plush furnishings and vibrant walls. Each room also has fantastic views across the snow capped mountains.</p>
<h2>Central location</h2>
<p><span>Surrounded by a landscape of magnificent snow-covered peaks and being ideally situated</span> in the centre of Avoriaz, you benefit from having ski in/ ski out access to the expansive Portes du Soleil ski area, and with 600 kilometres of runs to explore - there is enough to keep you occupied for the week. </p>
<h2>Relax and unwind</h2>
<p><span>The style of the Spa at the Hôtel des Dromonts pays tribute to the classics of Avoriaz , materials such as wooden tiles and slate combined with psychedelic decoration make you feel at peace once you enter the wellness area. </span><span>Sooth your achy ski legs in the outdoor whirlpool, or unwind in the sauna and hammam. There is also a relaxation area with </span><span>suspended armchairs, which is perfect for a moment of peace. Treat yourself to a</span><span> range of treatments including facials, manicures or relaxing and invigorating massages, which are available to book and pay for locally.</span></p>
<p><span>After a great day on the slopes of the Portes du Soleil, warm up in Le Festival bar with a hot chocolate, a local aperitif or a signature cocktail. With wool and leather armchairs and posters of the Avoriaz Fantastic Festival, it brings together the past and the present, it is a lovely area to enjoy after a day on the slopes or to have a cosy night in.</span></p>
<p>There are two superb restaurants to choose from, Les Enfants Terribles which is included with half board serving delicious evening meals inspired by the French cuisine, or receive credit towards informal dining in Le Festival restaurant which serves local specialities such as fondue or grilled meats, as well as burgers and other snack food.</p>
