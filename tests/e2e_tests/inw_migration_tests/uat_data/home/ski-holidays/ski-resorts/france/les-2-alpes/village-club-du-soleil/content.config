<h2>Great value</h2>
<p>The inclusive Village Club du Soleil ticks all the boxes for a family ski holiday. Lift passes and equipment are included for each guest, offering you unlimited access to the Les 2 Alpes ski area-  including one day in either the <a data-udi="umb://document/acff50eb9ad84862a464f68b551bc497" href="/{localLink:umb://document/acff50eb9ad84862a464f68b551bc497}" title="Alpe d'Huez">Alpe d'Huez</a> ''Grande Galaxie'' or a day of skiing in <a data-udi="umb://document/b7e31f4645514434bec76a3728e974c0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b7e31f4645514434bec76a3728e974c0}" title="Serre Chevalier">Serre Chevalier</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/4355b275387942f08b2416ccd4bee606" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4355b275387942f08b2416ccd4bee606}" title="Montgenèvre">Montgenèvre</a> or Puy St-Vincent. Comfortable rooms can sleep up to six are furnished in a modern style and have all the amenities needed for a week in Les 2 Alpes. Offered on a full board basis, all meals are 'all-you-can-eat ' served buffet style, table wine is also included. If you're wanting lunch on the mountains then there is the option to pre-order a picnic - otherwise you can return to the hotel and enjoy a varied buffet lunch on the sun terrace.</p>
<h2>Family friendly</h2>
<p>There's a range of children’s clubs included for children between 4 months to 5 years running six days a week throughout the winter season. Clubs for older children are run in the holiday periods with non-skiing outings and activities, which can be used if a child is in half day ski lessons. Depending on the age of the children, activities can include awareness games, outdoor activities and walks, crafts, mini discos and snowshoe outings.  </p>
<p>For the adults, there are two saunas with mountain views, accompanied snowshoe outings and evening entertainment (although that is great for the whole family). There is also a bar (pay locally) next to the stage, so you can relax with a drink or get involved in the games and activities hosted by the hotels own entertainment team.</p>
<h2>Ski in, Ski out</h2>
<p>Village Club du Soleil is an action packed ski in, ski out hotel in Les 2 Alpes. With a range of slopes for all levels in close proximity to the hotel, this is a fantastic choice for families. The piste side location gives unobstructed views of the mountains, so you can enjoy your surroundings even when you are not skiing.</p>
