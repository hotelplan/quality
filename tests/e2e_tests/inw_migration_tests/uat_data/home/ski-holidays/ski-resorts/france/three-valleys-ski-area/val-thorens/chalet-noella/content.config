  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chalet Noella is one of three chalets in a small residence at the entrance to the Balcons area of <a data-udi="umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8}" title="Val Thorens">Val Thorens</a>. The building is shared exclusively with Chalets <a data-udi="umb://document/65b4a42a6b4a41abbeb1d855ba97c925" href="/{localLink:umb://document/65b4a42a6b4a41abbeb1d855ba97c925}" title="Chalet Mathilde">Mathilde</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/50d7f9d96e7c4638bdcc2e69478973f1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/50d7f9d96e7c4638bdcc2e69478973f1}" title="Chalet Chloe">Chloe</a>. The entrance is on the top floor and a shared staircase leads to the chalets, which are each individually run and hosted. Chalet Noella <span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak">is available to book exclusively as well as room by room.</span></span></p>
<h2>Excellent location</h2>
<p>Val Thorens is connected to the <a data-udi="umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578" href="/{localLink:umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578}" title="Three Valleys Ski Area">Three Valleys,</a> Europe's largest lift-linked area, so skiers and snowboarders of all abilities can experience excellent snow coverage and a variety of slopes. The Chalet Noella is in an exceptional location in Val Thorens, to get on the slopes, pop on your skis and head down the Plein Sud blue, which runs through the village, ski directly to the lifts connecting the Three Valleys or turn right to descend to <a data-udi="umb://document/4eae720ba8984d83a83f530983b4b6f8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4eae720ba8984d83a83f530983b4b6f8}" title="Les Menuires">Les Menuires</a>.</p>
<p>The resort's centre is only a five-minute walk away, where a variety of shops, cafes, and restaurants can be found. If you have a day off from skiing, the resort offers a variety of activities, including the new Le Board sport centre.</p>
<h2>Chalet catering</h2>
<p>Throughout your holiday, your chalet hosts will be available to help you with anything you might need. On six of the seven days of the week, the hosts prepare home-cooked comfort food, including a cooked breakfast, afternoon tea snacks, and a four-course dinner with wine, beer and soft drinks. On staff day off the hosts will leave a continental breakfast out and you are free to spend the evening however you'd like in resort. In addition to preparing and serving your meals, the hosts will keep the chalet tidy for the duration of your stay. Since you are on holiday, your only responsibility is getting up to go skiing.</p>
<h2>Unwind and relax</h2>
<p>The chalet's interior is decorated in the traditional Alpine style and features comfortable furnishings throughout, including a living and dining area with an open layout. After a day spent exploring the Three Valleys, return to the chalet for afternoon tea to chill out with a cup of coffee and a sweet treat. Alternately, you can bask in the winter sun on the sun terrace, which features breath-taking views of the resort.</p>
<p>After a long day on the slopes, guests of the property are able to relax and rejuvenate in the wellness area, which includes a sauna and steam room.</p>
<h3>Why is this is an Inghams' Choice property?</h3>
<p><strong>Easy ski access</strong><span> </span>- Located a short walk away from the Plein Sud piste you have quick and easy access to the <a data-udi="umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578" href="/{localLink:umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578}" title="Three Valleys Ski Area">Three Valleys</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Close to resort</strong><span> </span>- Chalet Noella is a short walk to the resort centre where you can find plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. There are also plenty of other non-skiing activities to keep you entertained including the state of the art Le Board sport centre. </p>
<p><strong>Chalet hosts -</strong> Our chalet hosts are on hand to make your stay enjoyable, look forward to freshly prepared meals and relax knowing the tidying up is done for you - after all you are on holiday.</p>
<h3>Our chalets are going greener so our mountains don't</h3>
