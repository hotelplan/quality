  <cateringDescription><![CDATA[<p>The apartments include a food delivery service from our partners Huski. During the week you will receive breakfast, afternoon tea and a three course evening meal with wine, or soft drinks for the children. These meals will be for six days of the week and will be delivered in two stages, on your arrival and mid-week, and food can be stored in the fridge or freezer. The apartments are so comfortable that you will not want to go out in the evenings, except maybe once to treat yourself. Having the meal delivery service means that you can pop the food in the oven and enjoy delicious meals without the preparation and the shopping.</p>
<p>The menus are set, however if there is anything you are not keen on you can contact Huski directly. Vegetarians can be catered for, just let us know at the time of booking. </p>
