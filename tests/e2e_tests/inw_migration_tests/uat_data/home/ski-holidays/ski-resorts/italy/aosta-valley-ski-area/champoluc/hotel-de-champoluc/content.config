  <cateringDescription><![CDATA[<p>We know food is an essential part of any holiday, and even more so when you're skiing all day. Hotel de Champoluc won't disappoint—and don’t just take our word for it, check out the glowing online reviews. Best of all, the hotel’s chef, Michelle, has been working with owner Max for three years, and together they are an unstoppable team.</p>
<h3>Breakfast</h3>
<p>Each day begins with an impressive breakfast spread. Choose from a selection of juices and teas, or ask the staff for a freshly brewed coffee from the barista. Help yourself to a wide range of cereals, pancakes, waffles, freshly baked croissants, mini muffins, biscuits, yoghurts, honey, jams, Nutella, and a variety of gluten-free options. There are also hot items available daily, including eggs, bacon, and sausages.</p>
<h3>Afternoon tea </h3>
<p>When you return from the slopes in the afternoon, you'll be greeted with a selection of complimentary sweet and savory treats, soup, tea, and coffee in the lounge area. Chef Michelle prepares homemade treats that change daily, but we won’t spoil the surprise—you’ll have to find out for yourself! And if you're in the mood for a refreshing drink, the bar will be open.</p>
<h3>Dinner </h3>
<p>Dinner is the highlight of the day, and we’re confident you’ll agree. Start with a delicious array of antipasti and salads from the buffet, followed by freshly made pasta dishes such as filled ravioli, spaghetti carbonara, and lasagna, cooked right on the hot plate. Each evening, there’s a choice of a meat or vegetarian main course—yes, that’s after your pasta course! Expect dishes like beef Wellington, venison ragout, and locally sourced escalope.</p>
<p>If you still have room, there's a sweet dessert to enjoy, along with a cheeseboard or fresh fruit. And if the little ones aren’t keen on the dessert, the team can often provide ice cream upon request.</p>
<p>You’ll also enjoy a pre-dinner glass of prosecco, plus a choice of local red, white, or rosé wine with your meal, followed by tea and coffee. If you fancy splashing out on something a little more special, there is an impressive wine list to choose from. </p>
<p>After dinner you can speak to the bar staff and pay for a little tipple, as the Italians do. Italian local Genepy, various flavours of locally made Grappa, Vecchia Romagna – Italian brandy, Fernet Branca &amp; Amaretto are all ready and waiting. </p>
<p>Staff night off is once a week when there is no afternoon tea or dinner, so on this day you can explore the local restaurants in Champoluc. Breakfast on this day will be a continental breakfast.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day and New Year's Eve, a special celebration menu is prepared.</p>
<p>Please inform Inghams at the time of booking about any allergies or intolerances so that Max and his team can cater to your needs.</p>]]></cateringDescription>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ideally located next to the main Crest gondola and offering doorstep skiing, the Hotel de Champoluc is one of the top-rated hotels based on guest feedback. This winter, guests can also enjoy a brand-new wellness area, perfect for relaxing after a day on the slopes.</p>
<p><span data-teams="true">Enjoy excellent value at Hotel De Champoluc with half-board catering including wine with dinner and afternoon tea included, as well as flights, transfers and a ski away day to either Cervinia or Pila. </span></p>
<h2>Doorstep skiing</h2>
<p>Hotel de Champoluc offers ultimate convenience for getting on the slopes easily. The Crest gondola is just outside and at the end of the day, a piste will bring you back to the hotel. It is classified as a black run, but its lovely long and cruisy stretches can happily be skied by skiers with a few weeks experience. There are easier runs leading to the mid-station so beginner skiers can then take the gondola down the last stretch.</p>
<p>Our Inghams Rep will take care of all your skiing needs, sharing the best runs, après and more to ensure you have a fabulous time.</p>
<p style="background-color: #003457; color: white; text-align: center;"><strong>Save up to 50% on child places when booking for the 2024/25 ski season!<br /></strong>Visit the Facilities tab below to find out more.</p>
<h2>Exceptional Italian food </h2>
<p>Chef Michelle has been at the hotel for 3 years, crafting fresh, daily menus with a variety of dishes throughout the week. Your morning starts with a large breakfast, offering both hot and cold options, accompanied by freshly made barista coffee. After a day on the slopes, you'll return to a spread of sweet and savoury treats, along with soup, tea, and coffee. Drinks from the bar are payable locally.</p>
<p>Staff night off is once a week, on this day you can explore the local restaurants Champoluc has to offer for dinner. Breakfast on this day will be a continental breakfast. </p>
<p>Dinner is the highlight, featuring a selection of antipasti, salads, a freshly prepared pasta dish, a locally sourced meat option, a vegetarian dish, dessert and a cheeseboard. You’ll start the evening with a glass of prosecco and enjoy local wine throughout your meal, with wine upgrades available for an additional cost.</p>
<h2>Free ski away day to Cervinia or Pila</h2>
<p>Once a week throughout the Winter 2024/25 season, we arrange transport to either Cervinia or Pila for a ski away day. With your pre-booked lift pass, you have access to ski two days in another <a data-udi="umb://document/44c205035969462abff34bd958a9f9af" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44c205035969462abff34bd958a9f9af}" title="Aosta Valley Ski Area">Aosta Valley</a> resort, so there is nothing extra to pay for this day. Just give your name to the rep so we know you want to join us. It will usually run midweek and timings will be given in resort but the coach will leave in the morning and return late afternoon. Days may change from week to week as any trip will be weather dependent.</p>
<p>Want to see even more of the Aosta Valley? We have arranged a <span>stress-free tour of the local ski area with a local qualified guide for approx. £20 per person. Get your bearings on the first morning of your holiday and receive insight into the best runs as well as some useful pointers along the way to improve technique.</span></p>
<h2>New hotel wellness area</h2>
<p>This is the perfect spot to chill out with a sauna, steam room, sensory shower, relaxation room and infrared chairs. There is nowhere better for you to rest your ski legs. The spa is free of charge, you just need to book your time slots with reception. </p>
<h3>Why is this an Inghams' Choice property?</h3>
<p><strong>Service</strong><span></span>- We value the great partnerships we have with our hotels and our longstanding relationship with the Hotel De Champoluc means we know you are getting the very best on your Inghams holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Location </strong>- Doorstep skiing and easy access to the lifts. You can even ski another resort in the Aosta Valley with a pre-booked lift pass and our free ski away day to either Cervina or Pila. Just give your name to the reps on arrival to book your place on the coach.</p>
<p><strong>Value for money</strong>- Large bedrooms and easy slope access make the Hotel De Champoluc excellent value for money. Discounts are offered for a 3rd adult in a room and prices for drinks and lunches on the mountain are some of the best in the Alps. House wine is included with dinner so you can try some great Italian wines too. </p>]]></description>
