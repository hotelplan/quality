  <generalInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Beginner skiing and snowboarding in Whistler</h3>
<p>For those who have never skied or boarded before, Whistler is a fantastic place to start your adventure on the snow. With nearly 50 easy and gentle slopes across the resort, you have plenty of time to master that snowplough before moving on.</p>
<p>There are ski schools (both public and private) throughout the season for all ages, whether you want your children to experience the excitement of skiing for the first time, or you want to ski or board for the first time yourself!</p>
<p>Head up the Whistler Village Gondola or the Fitzsimmons Express to the Olympic Station, the easiest and calmest part of the mountain, made up of a majority of green slopes and marked slow zones. Perfect for building up your confidence on the slopes before heading on to more challenging runs.</p>
<h3>Ski schools in Whistler </h3>
<p>Whether you want to boost your confidence, improve your technique or simply challenge yourself, there are a range of ski schools available in Whistler catering to all ages and skill levels. </p>
<p>Beginners will have the opportunity to learn to ski or snowboard with some of the best instructors in the industry and you'll also benefit from lift line priority so you can really maximise your learning time. </p>
<p>For those of you with a little more experience under your belt, you can look into booking a speciality lesson with a guide, where you can either head to the snow park, try out some freestyle riding, racing or dominate those challenging steeps. </p>
<h3>Intermediate skiing and snowboarding in Whistler</h3>
<p>Intermediate skiers are described as being able to ‘ski parallel’ and can tackle most blue runs with confidence. If that sounds like you, then you’ll be pleased to know that Whistler is a great resort for those who just like to take it easy on the slopes.</p>
<p>There are over 100 blue runs across the Whistler and Blackcomb mountains so intermediate skiers and boarders will be well within their comfort zone, and for those willing to push themselves a little further, lots of blue runs lead to the starts of short black diamond runs.</p>
<p>There are some fantastic options available for intermediates who want to go that extra step further too: specialty ski school for improving your technique, and for those feeling a bit more daring, heli-skiing/boarding isn’t just for the advanced experts!</p>
<h3>Advanced skiing and snowboarding in Whistler </h3>
<p>Due to its wild nature, Whistler is a haven for the more advanced skiers and boarders.</p>
<p>Enjoy over 50 black runs across the Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains, and make the most of the backcountry and off-piste skiing, Whistler holds the record for the most ski and ride-able terrain out of all of the North American resorts.</p>
<p>Hop on to the Peak Express chairlift to make the most of the extreme runs and bowls that Whistler mountain has to offer, and stick within the marked areas for a bit of wild backcountry skiing and riding. There are also some great slopes and areas that can be accessed from the top of the 7th Heaven chair lift.</p>
<p>Heli-skiing/boarding is also another great way to make the most of your time in Whistler, especially for those with more advanced abilities to crave a little bit of deep, untouched power for a truly special day out!</p>
<h3>Off piste, Freestyle and terrain parks in Whistler </h3>
<p>For the bravest skiers and boarders out there who love nothing more than to show off their skills on the mountain, there are some fantastic freestyle parks across the Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, a variety of kickers, rails and boxes for an array of different abilities.</p>
<p>There is a real culture of freestyle skiing across the Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains with lessons available to those who want to push their advanced skiing ability a little bit further.</p>
<p>Freestyle and terrain parks across Whistler and Blackcomb come in a ranking system of S, M, L and XL. S being the smallest, offers the best features for those getting started with freestyle, while XL is the largest and definitely not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>Helmets and a high level of ability are mandatory in all parks.</p>
<p>If backflips and 360’s don’t really sound like your thing, you can always pause to watch the skiers and boarders show off their moves at the Fire and Ice Show: an eccentric show of music, dance, fire and skiing! Located at the Whistler Village plaza, this is an exhilarating stunt show that runs every Sunday during the peak season.</p>
<h3>Cross country skiing and snowboarding in Whistler </h3>
<p><span>Having hosted the Nordic events for the 2010 Winter Games, Whistler now boasts over 130 kilometres of cross-country trails. More than 90 kilometres are available at Whistler Olympic Park and an additional 30 kilometres can be found at Lost Lake Park in the heart of the village.</span></p>]]></generalInformation>

<h3>Restaurants, food and drink</h3>
<p>Whistler is proud of its huge variety of restaurants and bars dotted throughout the village. From fine dining with views of the mountains at the Bearfoot Bistro, Alto Bistro and Hy’s Steakhouse, through to the smaller, cheap’n’cheerful lunches offered at the Thunderbird Café and La Cantina, there is a huge range of gastronomy on offer in Whistler.</p>
<p>While you're there you have to try Canada's famous Ice-wine. It's an up-and-coming dessert wine and is typical to the British Columbia region. Because it's made from frozen grapes, the final product is much more concentrated and sweeter. It can't be made in many places, so we'd suggest trying it while you're there! </p>
<h3>Après, bars, clubs and nightlife</h3>
<p>There are plenty of evening options for those looking to shake off their boots and get down on the dance floor after a long day of skiing. Try the après at Dusty’s Bar and BBQ at the base of the Creekside Gondola (can be accessed by the Lower Peak to Creek blue slope from the top of Whistler mountain). The original après ski bar that was built in Whistler in the 1970’s has undergone a huge refurbishment but still holds on to some of that mountain cabin charm.</p>
<p>For those looking for some late night dancing, there’s Garfinkel’s Night Club and Moe Joe’s, both venues host guest DJ’s and regular themed nights out into the small hours of the morning.</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>Whistler is a great place to indulge in a bit of holiday shopping, offering a variety of different kinds of stores including those selling sports clothes and equipment (including The North Face and Salomon brand stores), fashion, luxury items and local crafts. There are also many gift shops around the village that offer authentic and traditional Canadian First Nations gifts.</p>
<p>Shopping trips to <a data-udi="umb://document/29418ba1ab4e4c3a81028c3e46a803ff" href="/{localLink:umb://document/29418ba1ab4e4c3a81028c3e46a803ff}" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> are easily organised and a few days in the city is highly recommended. Why not stay a few nights before or after your Whistler trip - give us a call and we'll arrange everything for you.</p>
<h3>Wellness and relaxation</h3>
<p>With all of the sport and non-stop ‘go’ attitude around Whistler, sometimes you just need to kick back and relax.</p>
<p>Relax your aching muscles with various top-notch spas around the village - the famous Scandinave Spa in Whistler incorporates age-old Finnish traditions of soaking and soothing in hot climes, and plunging into cold water showers for a real sensory experience!</p>
<p>If yoga is more your thing, enjoy a spot of yoga in Yogacara Whistler, in the heart of the village. </p>
<h3>Arts, culture and events</h3>
<p>In Whistler there is a wide selection of unique local art galleries, museums and collections including the Squamish Lil’wat Cultural Centre, built to preserve the history and culture of the Squamish and Lil’wat Nations. The centre hosts a wide variety of educational events and experiences.</p>
<p>There is a huge array of cultural events and festivals happening in and around Whistler all year, including ‘Cornucopia Whistler, a celebration of food and drink produced locally in the British Columbia. The festival runs for 10 days in November.</p>
<p>There is also the world famous Pride and Ski festival in January, the biggest gay and lesbian ski festival there is! The festival runs for a week and is easily the most colourful festival that the season has to offer.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the World Ski and Snowboard Festival (WSSF) in April, exclusive to Whistler, this festival celebrates snow sports, music and all around good times.</p>
<h2>Whistler Resort Activities </h2>
<h3>Zip Lining</h3>
<p>Enjoy an unforgettable opportunity to fly over the BC treetops and see Whistler from a different angle with a Ziptrek or Superfly zip lining experience. Most tours start and can be easily arranged from the village centre.</p>
<h3>Whistler Sliding Centre</h3>
<p>Located above the village on the side of Blackcomb Mountain, the Whistler Sliding Centre is a world-class bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track. You'll be able to slide like an Olympian with no prior experience, or explore the history and Olympic legacy on a sightseeing tour.</p>
<h3>Snowshoeing</h3>
<p>As everyone always says, if you can walk on your two feet, then you can snowshoe! Get away from the hustle and bustle of the village and ski slopes, and completely immerse yourself in nature.</p>
<p>Enjoy a guided tour that will follow the paths of the First Nations ancestors in Whistler and learn about the traditional uses of the forest bounties for survival in the harsh mountain climates, or go unguided and experience Whistler’s backcountry at your own pace.</p>
<h3>Tubing</h3>
<p>Enjoy a fun day out for all the family at the Whistler Blackcomb tube park that has 7 different lanes and over 1000ft of sliding fun!</p>
<p>There are suitable lanes for children as young as three years old (Mini-kids lane), as well as adults, and plenty of fun options for groups.</p>
<p>Wear your warm, waterproof clothing and after a day of tubing enjoy a cup of hot chocolate and other refreshments offered by the park.</p>
<h3>Ice skating</h3>
<p>A favourite Canadian past-time, you are spoilt for choice when it comes to ice skating in Whistler village.</p>
<p>Grab a pair of skates for a small fee and enjoy the Whistler Olympic Plaza ice rink during the winter months, for some outdoor ice skating (runs December-April), or enjoy the indoor facilities at the Meadow Park Sports Centre.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
