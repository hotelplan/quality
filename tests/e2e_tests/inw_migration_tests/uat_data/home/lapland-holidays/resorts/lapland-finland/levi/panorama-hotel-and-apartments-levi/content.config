  <description><![CDATA[<p>Located a short cable car ride up the fell, the Panorama Hotel and Apartments offer fantastic views, great food and attractive accommodation for a week long ski holiday in the heart of Lapland. </p>
<h2>Slope side location </h2>
<p>This property is in an idyllic area, right on the slope side of the Levi Fell and is Levi's only ski in / ski out hotel. All bedrooms and apartments offer excellent views of the slopes and Levi village, which is accessible via the Levi Express Cabin lift - You couldn't ask for a more convenient location if you tried.</p>
<h2>Comfortable accommodation </h2>
<p>The Panorama will tick all your boxes, with a range of hotel rooms, suites and apartments to choose from. All the accommodation available here is comfortable and modern and will provide the perfect base for your holiday.  You'll also have access to a communal sauna, which is the best way to warm up after a day out in the snow.</p>
<h2>Dining experience </h2>
<p>The Panorama focuses on delicious food, both international and Lappish classics, as well as good quality wines. The restaurant is located on the first floor of the building and offers great views of the courtyard from the cosy dining area.</p>
<p>During the evenings, have a drink under the stars in the Panorama's Sky Bar and Lounge. You'll find an array of wines and cocktails served here, as well as some fantastic views of the resort and fells.</p>
<p>If you can find it, we'd recommend taking a visit to Café Panorama Laavu - the secret café - which is located a short walk into the fell forest. This café is built around and open fire and the surrounding floor to ceiling windows allow you to enjoy the winter scenery from the warmth.</p>]]></description>
