  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Star Arctic is a modern and stylish hotel with spacious Lappish-style suites and Aurora cabins. A great choice for those looking for an intimate and exclusive feel stay. Located at the top of Kaunispaä fell, and away from the light pollution of the village centre it is an excellent spot to view the <a data-udi="umb://document/cb4bd30fc93b4d8389fe8d36c8a86995" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cb4bd30fc93b4d8389fe8d36c8a86995}" title="Northern Lights">Northern Lights</a>. The hotel is located approximately 2 kilometres from the <a data-udi="umb://document/b8a6a8fa31c94e959dc5959c1881f2d5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b8a6a8fa31c94e959dc5959c1881f2d5}" title="Saariselka">Saariselkä</a> centre and Inghams excursion pick-up point, which can be reached by ski bus or 30-minutes' pleasant walk.  </p>
<h2>Unforgettable experience </h2>
<p><span>Located in the northernmost region of Finnish Lapland, the Star Arctic Hotel immerses guests in the heart of the Arctic wilderness. Surrounded by snow-covered forests and pristine landscapes, it offers a secluded and serene retreat. </span>The unique aspect of the Star Arctic has to be the rooms. All of the suites are located within their own building,  a short walk from the main reception and restaurant area. The Suites have a large glass window overlooking the fells and village of Saariselka, Scenic View Suites with sauna and kitchenette are also available adding more comfort and space. </p>
<p>For an unforgettable experience, opt to spend your stay in a Glass Cabin where you can truly immerse in the nature of Lapland and if you're lucky, even admire the Northern Lights from your bed. We love the colourful light settings controlled by the main remote - but we don't want to spoil all the surprises.</p>
<h2>Lappish flavours</h2>
<p>Enjoy casual dining in the hotel's restaurant, located in the main building, and enjoy beautiful views across the fell. Natural ingredients are sourced from the local area including fish from the Inari region and reindeer from traditional Sami farms plus their full menu, originally crafted by Finnish Michelin Star Chef Jouni Toivanen, combines local Lappish flavours with popular modern cuisines bringing a uniquely elegant and casual choice for all. Enjoy a buffet breakfast and a multi course dinner served to the table.</p>
<h2>Wellness facilities</h2>
<p><span>The hotel has two privately bookable saunas where you can unwind after a day of outdoor activities, or we have Scenic View Suites with saunas available, offering the perfect way to warm up and rejuvenate. From the large windows within the saunas, you can admire the endless fell landscape, the winter nights and the northern lights in the frosty night, if you are lucky enough. Stay active in the well-equipped gym with large windows or enjoy a relaxing drink in the lobby bar, both of which are located in the main building.</span></p>]]></description>
