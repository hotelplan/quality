  <description><![CDATA[<p>Stay slope side at the Panorama Hotel and Apartments. Enjoy fantastic views across Levi village, with great food and attractive accommodation for a week long ski and activity break in the heart of Lapland. </p>
<h2>Slope-side stays</h2>
<p>This property is in an idyllic area, right on the slope side of the Levi Fell. It's Levi's only ski in / ski out hotel - you'll have direct access to the red runs on the Front Slopes. From this elevated position you'll have stunning views across the surrounding pine forests, the slopes and Levi village. The hotel is easily accessible via the Levi Express Cabin gondola - tickets included when you purchase a Levi ski pass or available to purchase from Panorama Hotel reception - it's free in the evenings (from approx. 6.30pm-11pm). If you're feeling active, get wrapped up warm, and take the 766 steps that lead you all the way to the centre of the village. </p>
<h2>Comfortable accommodation </h2>
<p>The Panorama ticks all the boxes, with a range of stylish hotel rooms, suites and apartments to choose from. The comfortable and modern rooms and apartments will provide the perfect base for your holiday whether you're travelling as a couple, family or group. If you're staying in the hotel rooms you'll have access to the hotel's scenic sauna's too. They're located on the 7th floor and have beautiful views -  it's the best way to warm up after a day out in the snow! The sauna area has a cosy lounge and a balcony, as well as dressing rooms, showers and separate sauna's for men and women. Whereas if you choose an apartment you'll have your very own private sauna to use. </p>
<h2>Dining experience </h2>
<p>The Panorama focuses on delicious food, both international and Lappish classics, as well as good quality wines. The restaurant is located on the first floor of the building and offers great views of the courtyard from the cosy dining area.</p>
<p>During the evenings, have a drink under the stars in the Panorama's Sky Bar and Lounge. You'll find an array of wines and cocktails served here, as well as some fantastic views of the resort and fells.</p>]]></description>
