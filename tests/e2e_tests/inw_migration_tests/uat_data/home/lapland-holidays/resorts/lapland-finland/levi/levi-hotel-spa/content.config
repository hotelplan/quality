<p>Levi Hotel Spa is <a data-udi="umb://document/1b2fbafe6b3546cbbcb8a26241bb809c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/1b2fbafe6b3546cbbcb8a26241bb809c}" title="Levi">Levi's</a> flagship property, i<span>deally located in the centre of the arctic village. It's a great choice for families, couples and groups. With a range of facilities including the Spa Water World, fitness room and variety of restaurants, this hotel ticks all the boxes for a winter escape. Each of the rooms is tastefully decorated to a</span> high standard with a Finnish style throughout. </p>
<h2>Central location</h2>
<p>The resort centre is about three minutes (300 metres) walk away, where you can find a variety of bars and cafes featuring live music, as well as restaurants and shops selling traditional Lappish trinkets and gifts. Take advantage of the winter wonderland and snow-covered fells close to Levitunturi, as well as the ski slopes which are just a short walk away. Skiing in Lapland is a unique experience, as the slopes are often flood lit, so you can ski after the sun goes down. Plus the well groomed pistes are perfect for beginner skiers and intermediates who enjoy gentle blues and reds. </p>
<h2>Levi Spa Water World</h2>
<p><span>The hotel has excellent spa and recreation facilities included, making it a perfect hotel for families and couples alike.  Entrance to Spa Water World is included in your stay, with seventeen indoor and outdoor pools, waterslides, Jacuzzis, plus nine sauna/steam rooms.  There is also an onsite gym and yoga studio, as well as various beauty and massage treatments available to book locally. Children can visit the children's play area, think little igloos with a TV, a big foam pit and other fun activities, it is a great spot to meet new friends. That's exactly why this is one of Inghams' favourite hotels.</span></p>
