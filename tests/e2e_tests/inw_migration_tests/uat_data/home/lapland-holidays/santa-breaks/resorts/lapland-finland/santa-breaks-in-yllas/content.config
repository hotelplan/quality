<li>Located in the Arctic Circle </li>
<li>Traditional Lappish cabins and cosy apartments</li>
<li>Pre-booked activities and excursions</li>
<li>3 or 4 night holidays </li>
</ul>
<p>Ylläs is an idyllic unspoiled area of Lapland with marvellous scenery and high-quality cosy log cabins dotted around the woods. This resort really allows you to appreciate the true beauty of nature that Lapland has to offer - the skies here are especially clear, ideal for witnessing the magical Northern Lights and you may even spot wild reindeer roaming around. Our Ylläs Santa Break trips allow you to enjoy an unforgettable short break in December to get the whole family well and truly into the festive spirit in the run up to Christmas!</p>
<h2><span>A true taste of the Arctic wilderness</span></h2>
<p><span>Ylläs is situated in the western part of Lapland, approximately 150 kilometres above the Arctic Circle. It encompasses three villages, Äkäslompolo, Ylläsrinne and Ylläsjärvi, which are surrounded by pristine natural beauty. The landscape is dominated by vast forests, crystal-clear lakes, and rolling fells (their equivalent to mountains) making this resort a haven for nature lovers. The region also has a rich indigenous Samí heritage, and you'll have the chance to learn about Samí culture, traditions, and history during your stay.</span></p>
<h2>Meet Santa</h2>
<p><span>All of our three and four night Santa Breaks include a visit to Santa's Elves Hideaway, which is a short drive from resort. </span><span>Santa's Elves Hideaway is tucked away in a whimsical, snow-covered forest, adorned with twinkling candlelight. It's a magical place where the whole family can immerse themselves in an enchanting atmosphere. </span>Join the fun at one of Santa's magical workshops and make delicious gingerbread with Santa's friendly elves, or make join in the crafts and make a souvenir which will last a lifetime, you can even meet Santa's reindeer. There will also be plenty of exciting snow games for you to enjoy including tobogganing. The highlight of the day is meeting Santa in his cosy grotto - each family will have a private meeting with Santa and children will receive a present during the visit.</p>
<h2>Arctic Activities </h2>
<p>Your Lapland holiday wouldn't be complete without some exciting winter excursions. We have a range of activities available to pre-book which allow you to engage in the unique Lappish culture and traditions of the region. You can race across frozen lakes and snowy landscapes on a husky sleigh ride, cosy up under a blanket and enjoy a reindeer sleigh ride through the scenic forests or whiz your way through the fells on an exhilarating snowmobile safari. Aspiring skiers and boarders are also in luck as you can add on a 'Ski Taster' package on our four night stays, which include lift passes, equipment and lessons. Ylläs is a great ski resort offering pistes for all abilities, with some fantastic beginner slopes, small classes and friendly English-speaking ski instructors. </p>
<h2>What's included in an Inghams Santa Break to Ylläs </h2>
<p>On an Ingham's Santa Breaks holiday you'll have your flights, transfers and accommodation, a farewell feast and a visit to Santa's Elves Hideaway including private meeting with Santa, included within your package. All you'll need to do is decide which arctic activities you want to add on and there are plenty of options. We also include arctic thermal suits and warm snow boots for all adults and children (3 years and over - as these breaks are not recommended for infants), meaning you can 'come as you are' with your normal winter outdoor clothing, and we'll do the rest, so you can relax and enjoy snowy Lapland. Our Inghams Destination Experts based in <span>Ylläs</span> are also on hand to ensure you make the most of your Lapland holiday - if you need any advice, tips or assistance while you're away, they're more than happy help. </p>

<p><strong>4 nights</strong> Wednesday to Sunday.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 1</strong></p>
<p>Your Inghams Santa Breaks Reps will be waiting at Kittilä airport to warmly welcome you to Lapland and bring you, by coach, to your accommodation. Shortly after arriving in Ylläs, you will collect your complimentary thermal suits and boots, which you will keep for the duration of your stay. Our team will welcome you to the resort and are on hand to help you plan your activities for the next few days - see below for options.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 2</strong> </p>
<p>Today is the day! The time has come to meet the big man himself. A magical jaunt is in store with a visit to Santa's Elves Hideaway. Here each family will enjoy an exclusive private meeting with Santa - make sure you’ve written your letters! You can also take part in supervised festive games, cook sausages on an open fire, help the elves bake gingerbread biscuits and try making your own decorations in Elf School. Outdoors you can catch the snowmobile train (on the hunt to find Santa) or have great fun tobogganing in the snow. All children will receive a small gift - souvenirs that can be treasured for years.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 3</strong> </p>
<p>Make the most of your stay by booking our exciting optional excursions. Perhaps a combined husky and reindeer farm visit (or Husky Safari if you're staying in the Ylläsrinne Cabins) with sleigh rides in the morning, followed by an exhilarating family-friendly snowmobile safari in the afternoon. Alternatively, wander around the local shops collecting souvenirs or relax and enjoy a sauna at your accommodation in true Finnish style!</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>On Your Last Night</strong> </p>
<p>Get ready for a Festive Feast! An evening of party games, music and festive food. Tuck into a buffet of traditional roast turkey Christmas dinner plus Lappish specialities.</p>
<p><em>Please note that the Festive Feast takes place on Day 4 for guests staying 4 nights.</em></p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 4</strong> (for 4 night guests only!)</p>
<p>Today you can choose whether to book additional winter activities and safaris or try a few hours skiing on the wide, uncrowded Ylläs slopes. Pre-book our exclusive Inghams 'ski taster' package (not available for Ylläsrinne guests) to give it a go. Perhaps you would prefer to wander around the local craft shops (if staying in Äkäslompolo) or simply play in the snow. Then get ready for your Festive Feast in the evening <em>(see Day 3 for details)</em>. After dinner, perhaps the Northern Lights will appear for that perfect end to your holiday.</p>
<p style="color: #69182f;"><strong>DAY 5</strong> (or DAY 4 for 3 night guests)</p>
<p>After a magical few days, it’s time to say goodbye to your new friends before being transferred by coach to the airport for your flight home.</p>
<p><em>Please note the above itinerary may vary according to arrival and departure times. Pre-booked excursion itineraries and timings will be advised on arrival in the resort.
