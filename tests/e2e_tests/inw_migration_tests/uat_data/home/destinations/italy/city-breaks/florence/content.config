  <description><![CDATA[<p>Florence is a city made by art lovers for art lovers. Botticelli, da Vinci, Michelangelo, the Medici clan… a whole roll call of famous names lived in the city in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. These thinkers, artists and political theorists sparked a flurry of art and ideas that we now call the Renaissance. Walking holidays in Florence uncover a work of art around every corner, from the cathedral’s magnificent Brunelleschi Dome to footpaths that lead to sculptural gardens. You can still feel that vital spark here, too – especially when people spill out onto the streets on warm summer evenings to put the world to rights over a glass of Chianti.</p>
<h2>Discovering Florence on foot</h2>
<p>The streets of Florence are a walkable work of art, with the Piazza del Duomo a great starting point. From here, roads run parallel to the Arno, framed with world-famous galleries, restaurants, wine bars, churches and shops. Ponte Vecchio, with its medieval wooden-shuttered shops and arches over the river. From there, it’s a climb up to Palazzo Pitti, and up again to the Boboli Gardens for views over the city below. Walking tours led by local guides are the best way to learn about the Florentine past and present, revealing just how the Renaissance transformed Europe.</p>
<h2>Eating out: feasts alla Fiorentina</h2>
<p>Regular refuelling is required to get you around all those galleries and beautiful streets. It’s a good thing, then, that Florence is piled high with hole-in-the-wall bars, pizzerias, Michelin restaurants, family trattorias and markets. City specialities include supersized steaks (bistecca alla Fiorentina), arancini, bread salad (panzanella; more delicious than it sounds) and thin-crust pizza.</p>
<p>As for a digestif, sweet vin santo is served with cantucci – the Florentine edition of biscotti. Crema Fiorentina gelato is a must-try too, whipped up for a Medici wedding in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and flavoured with a generous glug of honey. For a more hands-on approach, sign up to a cooking class headed up by a local chef who’ll teach you the tricks of cooking up a Tuscan feast</p>
<h2>A window into the world of Tuscan wine</h2>
<p>Florence makes itself at home in the heart of Chianti country. Visit a wine estate in the hills to learn all about the history of the first named wine region in Italy. Back in Florence city centre, almost 200 wine windows (or buchette di vino) are ensconced in walls around the city; originally used to sell drinks and food at the time of the plague. Seek out the functioning few, some of which were revived at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Negronis are the cocktail of choice in Florence, sipped in a sun-warmed piazza or at the pop-up beach bar that emerges like a mirage on the banks of the Arno each summer.</p>
<h2>Exploring Tuscany</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe that anyone can have their fill of Florence, but if you’re curious about what lies beyond the city limits then there are plenty of easy explorations to hand. In the north, streets zigzag into the green hills stacked behind the city, past churches, grand villas and panoramic picnic spots. Sedate strolls come courtesy of the riverside walking and cycling path along the Arno, which wanderers can trace east to Girone. For a complete change of scene, Pisa and Lucca and <a data-udi="umb://document/ddef5c7c9bdb475792ae27614a6308b8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ddef5c7c9bdb475792ae27614a6308b8}" title="Montecatini">Montecatini</a> are within day-tripping distance by train or coach, as well as dreamy Tuscan hilltop towns such as Montepulciano.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Bring out your inner da Vinci on a Florence city break - explore the art, admire the architecture and fill up on the food]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Things to see and do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Uffizi Gallery: </em>A must see attraction for any art lover. The world-famous Ufizzi Gallery is home to outstanding collections of paintings and sculptures from the middle ages to modern times.</li>
<li><em>Accademia Gallery: </em>Home to Michelangelo’s sculpture of David. Give yourself time to explore the other halls in the gallery too, they will be much less busy and hold some of the finest examples of painting, sculpture and even ancient musical instruments in Italy.</li>
<li><em>Piazza della Signoria: </em>Florence's main square is dominated by the towering Palazzo Vecchio, close to the Ufizzi, Ponte Vecchio and the Duomo - it’s the gateway to many of the city’s most famous attractions. There’s plenty to see in the square itself as its filled with sculptures and fountains, including a replica of the famed Michelangelo’s David.</li>
<li><em>Museo di Palazzo Vecchio: </em>Florence’s town hall is a symbol of its powerful past. Built in the style of a castle with a tower reaching 94 metres, the building stands tall in Piazza della Signoria. Take a look inside to discover Giorgio Vasari’s "Salone dei Cinquecento".</li>
<li><em>Ponte Vecchio: </em>Possibly the most famous bridge in the world and one of the few in Italy that survived WWII. The bridge makes up part of the Vasari Corridor, a passageway that connects Palazzo Vecchio with Palazzo Pitti and crosses the River Arno. The enclosed bridge is lined with artisan shops selling glittering jewels.</li>
<li><em>Palazzo Pitti: </em>Palazzo Pitti stands at the base of Boboli Hill. It was built in the mid 1400’s by the Florentine Banker, Paulo Pitti to challenge the Medici family and is thought to have been designed by the great renaissance architect Brunelleschi.</li>
<li><em>Boboli Gardens: </em>The green expanse was established by the Medici family in a layout that is now known as the Italian style, a model used in many European court gardens. Today it’s a lovely tranquil space in the city, it’s not just a garden but an outdoor museum where you’ll see beautiful examples of Renaissance sculpture.</li>
<li><em>Oltrarno Craft Shops: </em>The labyrinth of streets that surround Palazzo Pitti are home to lots of tiny artisan shops and workshops like shoemakers, bookbinders and ceramicists. It's great for those who want to explore off the beaten track.</li>
<li><em>Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore: </em>You can't miss Florence's iconic cathedral with its magnificent Renaissance dome. You can even climb the 463 steps to the top of the cupola where you can admire the frescos up close.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Food &amp; drink</strong></p>
<p>You can expect some fantastic food and wine in Tuscany's capital. We love bistecca fiorentina - a large t-bone cut steak seasoned with local herbs. The food in the city is hearty and locally produced. Stews, pastas and wild boar feature on most menus. After dinner, you need to try the gelato. Florence has some of the best in Italy.</p>
<p>For the most authentic dishes, we love mercato centrale. It's a large two-floor market with stalls selling fresh produce on the ground floor and pop up restaurants on the top floor - it's our favourite place for lunch.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
