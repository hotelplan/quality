  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Soak up history at the Grotte di Catullo and Scaligero Castle</li>
<li>Saunter around ancient cobbled streets</li>
<li>Indulge in a gelato by the lakeside</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at a map of Lake Garda, and you’ll see a delicate peninsula unfurling from the southern shore. This is Sirmione – one of the most striking towns in the Italian Lakes. It packs a lot into that thread of land. Scaligero Castle is the photogenic crown, but there are also medieval lanes, a beach, Roman ruins, olive groves, thermal spas and a glut of gelaterie to explore – and all on traffic-free streets. Beyond the historic centre, you can continue with summery lakeside walks along the promenade or board one of the many ferries that hop between the glimmering towns on Lake Garda’s shore.</p>
<h3>Scaligero Castle: immerse yourself in Lake Garda's rich history</h3>
<p>Sirmione is framed by jewel-green water and spectacular lake views on three sides. A moat marks the entrance to the pedestrian-friendly historic centre at the end of the peninsula. Cross it to Scaligero Castle, which was designed to be an all-seeing defensive outpost for the Della Scala family, who ruled the Verona region in the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries. Climb all the way up to the balustrade and tower for a bird’s eye view of the terracotta-tiled, green-shuttered streets below. From here, you can also admire the brooding mountains on the more northerly shores of Lake Garda; particularly striking in the summer sunshine.</p>
<h3>Walking away from the crowds</h3>
<p>Most people visiting Sirmione are day-trippers who mill around the historic centre, castle and harbour before going on their way. But by staying for a walking holiday in Sirmione, you’ll have the time to explore the whole 3km-long peninsula (and its famous gelaterie) at leisure. One of the best walks in the summer is over-looked by many visitors. Simply continue beyond the castle to the Roman ruins of Grotte di Catullo at the far end of the peninsula. Jamaica Beach sits below, accessed via a path which passes through silvery olive groves.</p>
<h3>From Roman spa town to luxury lake-view spas</h3>
<p>The spa-loving Romans were the first people recorded to enjoy the waters of Sirmione. These days, weary wanderers can still soothe their legs with a soak in one of thermal baths. Sulphuric, iodine-rich water heats the lake-view pools of stylish spas to a balmy 36°C. For more in the way of relaxation, finish a day of walking along lakeside promenades with dinner of delicious local food and drink by the lake. While it attracts day-trippers by the hundreds, Sirmione is also a relaxed spot for a drink by the water on a lazy summer evening after the crowds depart.</p>
<h3>Exploring Lake Garda</h3>
<p>Watersports on <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> are a popular summer attraction.

It’s a renowned spa destination, using thermal waters that have been enjoyed since Roman times. It’s also a fantastic place to take a lakeside walk whilst sampling authentic gelato. With loads of gelaterie dotting the historic town centre, Sirmione serves some of the best ice-cream on the lake.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Rocca di Manerba</h3>
<p>A beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site and nature reserve near Sirmione which has several routes for you to enjoy. It’s above lake-level and so has the most incredible views of the lake, as if you’re on a Greek Island looking over the lapis lazuli sea. For history and archaeology lovers this is a complete hidden gem, as various excavations have uncovered the remains of pre-historic settlements, some dating back to the 4<sup>th</sup> Century Bronze Age! This nature reserve is well worth a day trip if you’re in the area and will give you a completely different perspective on walking in the South of Lake Garda.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Getting there: </strong>To get to Manerba from Sirmione it takes about an hour on the bus. Taking the LN026 bus to Desenzano and then changing onto the LN006 bus to Manerba (Via IV Novembre). From there it’s about a 25 minute walk up to the nature reserve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rocca Scaligera – Jamaica Beach – Grotte di Catullo</h3>
<p>This circular trail bring together some of Sirmione’s most popular sites. From walking along the long stretch of lakeside on the Sirmione pensinsula to admiring the crystal clear waters at the tip on Jamaica beach, Robinson Crusoe style, to the Catullo caves, an ancient archaeological site – where the ruins of a Roman villa from the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BC still stand. This is a really easy loop to walk along, but it’s full of gems which will help you get to know Sirmione’s hotspots. We’d recommend doing this walk at a quieter time in the day, so you can experience it with less people milling around.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4km (walking time approx. 1 hour)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent and descent:</strong> 66 metres </li>
<li><strong>Terrain: </strong>Asphalt surfaces, rocky/sandy beaches</li>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>History and culture in Sirmione</h3>
<p>Sirmione town has a rich history so there’s lots to explore and learn. The Grotte di Catullo are fascinating Roman ruins at the tip of the peninsula and the ancient Scaligero Castle, which was built during the La Scala family dynasty is a fantastic historic site to behold. Sirmione’s been known for its healing thermal waters since the Roman times and there’s plenty of places to enjoy them on the tiny peninsula. Aquaria’s our go-to place when we need to relax - it has the biggest pools and over 10,000 square metres to chill out in.</p>
<h3>Exploring further afield: hopping from town to town on Lake Garda and discovering Verona</h3>
<p>It’s easy to get to other resorts on the lake as ferries run all day from the central port. Head over to <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a> where you can take the cable car up to Monte Baldo and explore a fantastic walking area with panoramic views of the lake and surrounding mountains. If you're looking for some really challenging uphill ascents, then Limone's the town to go to- there are no cable cars here, so getting up to the top of the mountain requires mountain goat abilities!</p>
<p>If culture is what you're looking for, or you're a literary fanatic, them jump on the bus, and you can be in <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona</a> in under an hour. Verona's a fantastic city to walk around– its main attractions are all within walking distance, so it's easy to see all the sights in one day; cross the Ponte Pietra and walk up to the Piazzale Castel San Pietro for stunning views of the city.</p>
<h3>Savouring food &amp; wine on Lake Grrda</h3>
<p>You can't leave Sirmione without testing out the ever popular gelato. There are plenty of gelaterie in the pedestrianised centre, so pick out your favourite flavour (or two, or three) and savour it as you wander along the lakeside promenade in the summer sunshine. When it's time for lunch or dinner, walk over to Piazza Carducci where you'll be spoilt for choice for restaurants and cafés.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in Sirmione</h3>
<p>While Sirmione may not be the first place that comes to mind for the avid walker, this is the ideal resort if you’re looking for some really easy and relaxed walks on a flat piece of land. In Sirmione you’ll really have time to experience the town, the parks, the beaches and the lakeside promenades and there are no strenuous climbs to get to those sought after viewpoints. Stroll along the lakefront with an ice-cream in hand or do a loop of the Sirmione Peninsula, keeping the shoreline in sight every step of the way.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
