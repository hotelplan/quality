  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bardolino, Bardolino – where are you, Bardolino? Many know the name from the well-quaffed red wine that comes from the region, but few can place it on a map. But those who do know visit – and then visit again and again. You’ll find Bardolino in the south-east of <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, reclined between two headlands. It wraps a piazza-topped old town and waterfront promenade into one easily walkable package – and then hands out walking, ferry and train routes so you can extend your summer holiday exploration to Lake Garda’s towns and vineyards, and on to fair <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7}" title="Venice">Venice</a>.</p>
<h3>Exploring Bardolino's old town</h3>
<p>You’ll never get lost walking around Bardolino’s old town, no matter how aimless your strolling – all roads lead to the lake. Once through the lovely stone gateway, it’s an easy ramble past Romanesque churches, a café-lined main piazza and shuttered houses in gelato shades of clementine and cream. There’s usually music in the air too. What was once an old church, Sala della Disciplina, hosts opera, while terraces fill with buskers and musicians in the summer.</p>
<h3>Family walking by Lake Garda</h3>
<p>A promenade hugs the lake’s edge between Bardolino and <a data-udi="umb://document/689f022eb7974a7087ccbecf4adbda43" href="/{localLink:umb://document/689f022eb7974a7087ccbecf4adbda43}" title="Garda">Garda</a>. It’s a leisurely hour-long walk or speedier bike ride – longer if you pause at the beaches and lake-view benches en route, great places to stop off with children to rest little legs. The walled town of Lazise is also an easy walk away, home to one of the grandest castles of the Scaligeri family, who ruled the region for over 100 years. The Way of Bardolino as it is known is a collection of walking routes that will take you a little further afield. Take your pick from 75km of paths and 18 nature trails, dipping into whichever vineyards take your fancy as you go along. The nature trails and easy walking paths around Bardolino are ideal for families, as they're not too challenging.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Bardolino wine in style</h3>
<p>Bardolino vineyards have lined the southern edge of Lake Garda since Roman times. The red wine is loved across the world for its fruity flavour – but, of course, is best drunk in its hometown, preferably with a side of risotto and sunny lake views. Time your summer holiday to Bardolino for September’s wine festival (Festa dell’Uva di Bardolino) to celebrate the region’s greatest grapes. The Olive Oil Museum in neighbouring Cisano shows off another regional speciality, along with antique presses and an olive oil library.</p>
<h3>Day trips from Bardolino</h3>
<p>In the summer, ferries cruise between the wooden piers of Lake Garda, connecting picturesque towns such as castle-topped <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione</a> and the <a data-udi="umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11}" title="Gardone Riviera">Gardone Riviera</a>. Most ferries accept bikes, so you can take the family for a day of cycling on Lake Garda. Why not cycle one way and hop on the boat for the return trip – or vice versa. Alternatively, head to Desenzano or Peschiera, where trains zip off to Venice and Verona, where you can spend the day walking around and soaking up the sights. From this part of the lake make sure you check out the nearby Caneva Aquapark or Lake Garda's famous Gardaland theme park; perfect for keeping children entertained!</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Bardolino to Cisano</h3>
<p>A pleasant walk along the lakefront that leads from Bardolino to Cisano, a district of Bardolino. This is a really unique part of the lake due to its stretches of coastline freckled with reeds. Check out the lake‘s rich bird life and deep dive into the typical fish and avifauna at Museo Sisàn.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> Easy<br /><strong>Distance:</strong> 8km<br /><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 3.5 hours<br /><strong>Ascent/descent:</strong> 5m<br /><strong>Terrain:</strong> mostly paved with short dirt sections, flat</p>
<h3>The Ridges of Monte Baldo</h3>
<p>This walk heads up to the ridges of Monte Baldo where the views across Lake Garda are breath-taking. Starting in Malcesine (accessible by ferry or bus from Bardolino) hop on the Monte Baldo cable car (payable locally) which will take you up Monte Baldo. Taking the cable car means you won't have long to wait before getting your first glimpse of Lake Garda and the surrounding mountains from the top!</p>
<p>Grade: Challenging<br />Distance: 10km<br />Walking time: approx. 5 hours<br />Ascent/descent: 500m<br />Terrain: some dirt trails, sections of rocky and uneven terrain, steep ascents</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Bardolino is a lively Lake Garda resort with a lakeside promenade, perfect for walking to Garda and beyond this summer…]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Exploring Lake Garda</h3>
<p>Jump on a ferry and visit the other towns on Lake Garda. <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione</a> will take about an hour – head here to get some fab holiday photos of the castle and moat, plus try the town’s famous ice cream! Hop across the lake to <a data-udi="umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7c2039e31003455f9c5af8c11e6f0e11}" title="Gardone Riviera">Gardone</a> and visit the Heller Botanical Gardens – we love spending the summer afternoons admiring the flowers and the art.</p>
<p>If you want some thrills, there are plenty of family activities on offer. Spend a day at a theme park. Gardaland, Caneva Aquapark and Movieland are all close by. To get your culture fix, head to <a data-udi="umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/201893063f65496384a9bd17846543a7}" title="Venice">Venice</a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona</a> for the day. Trains run regularly from stations in Desenzano and Peschiera.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; wine in Bardolino</h3>
<p>Bardolino is serious about its wine and there are lots of opportunities to learn all about it by taking trips to the nearby vineyards. Go to the Zeni Winery for a tasting and tour of the vines; one of our favourite activities on a warm summer's afternoon! There’s a great museum there too. The Bardolino Wine Festival takes place twice a year. There are plenty of opportunities to taste the wines and sample regional food specialties, all accompanied by musical concerts ending in a spectacular firework display over the lake. Bardolino's <a rel="noopener" href="https://visitbardolino.it/en/eventi/palio-del-chiaretto/?occurrence=2023-05-26" target="_blank" data-anchor="?occurrence=2023-05-26">Palio del Chiaretto</a> takes place at the end of May and celebrates rosé wine whilst the <a rel="noopener" href="https://visitbardolino.it/en/eventi/festa-del-vino-bardolino/?occurrence=2023-09-28" target="_blank" data-anchor="?occurrence=2023-09-28">Bardolino Grape &amp; Wine Festival</a> which takes place between September and October celebrates all that is wine!</p>
<p>As well as wine, Bardolino is known for its olive oil. You’ll find a museum about two kilometres outside the town where you can see traditional equipment used to make the oil and a shop where you can buy some of the produce.</p>
<h3>Summer Activities on Lake Garda</h3>
<p>There are lots of great walking trails that start in Bardolino. As the area’s fairly flat, it’s good for beginners. We like the lakeside walks - you can go for about an hour in each direction and stop off for an aperitivo on the way. Head to the top of La Rocca for the best views. Bardolino also has some great cycling, including mountain biking trails and more peaceful routes that follow the lake edge. You can cycle round the whole lake if you want to, or just choose part of it and head back on a ferry. There are places locally where you can hire bikes and some of our hotels have bikes you can borrow.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a paper map to help you get to know the area even better, we'd recommend the Kompass 697 - Lake Garda (1:35,000).</p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The lakes and mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Bardolino</h3>
<p>You'll stumble across vineyards and olive groves galore when you begin venturing out of the centre of Bardolino. There's nothing better than stopping off at a typical Bardolino vineyard and sharing a tipple or two with good friends mid-walk! There are so many surprises in the area, check out the Bronze Age rock carvings on Monte Luppia or walk to the Sisan museum and jump head first into learning about the lake's bird life and water life.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>

I love to walk along the lakeside path all the way to the neighbouring town of Garda, stopping halfway to enjoy a refreshing Aperol spritz at one of the waterfront bars. The views are different depending on whether you’re walking up towards Garda’s port or back down to Bardolino, and if you time it right you can catch a beautiful, hazy sunset over the tranquil lake.'</span></span></p>",
