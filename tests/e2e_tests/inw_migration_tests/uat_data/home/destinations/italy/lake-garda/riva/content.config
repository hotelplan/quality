  <description><![CDATA[<p>Riva, in the far north of Lake Garda, rolls out a waterfront that’s almost as grand as the mountains behind. Roman, Venetian, Napoleonic and Austro-Hungarian rulers have all occupied this prized position between the Italian Alps, lakes and plains, leaving behind a richly decorated lakeside promenade and old town. Thanks to the Mediterranean climate, olive, cypress, palm and lemon trees thrive in Riva, making for some of the most scenic walking and cycling paths in Italy. Plus, the jagged peaks of the Dolomites are on the doorstep… if you can bear to peel yourself away from Riva, that is.</p>
<h3>Family activities by (and on) Lake Garda</h3>
<p>Life revolves around the water in Riva del Garda. Day-trippers come and go by boat and restaurants and cafés set out their tables along the sun-trapped promenade. This stretch of shore is also a favourite spot for windsurfing, canoeing and sailing aficionados. Stroll or cycle along the promenade to neighbouring Torbole, passing sand and pebble beaches along the way. You’ll find that it’s nearly impossible to resist abandoning your bike or boots for a dip in the lake.</p>
<h3>Swap Lake Garda for Ledro for the day</h3>
<p>The emerald waters of <a data-udi="umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b}" title="Lake Ledro">Lake Ledro</a> are just a half-hour bus ride away from Riva. This high alpine lake is another irresistible swimming spot, as well as a great place for delving into the region’s pre-Roman history at the open-air Pile-dwelling museum. Alternatively, head to Lake Ledro via one of the best walking and cycling paths in Lake Garda – the panoramic Strada del Ponale (Ponale Road).</p>
<h3>Walking around Riva old town</h3>
<p>Riva has one of the most picturesque waterfronts in Lake Garda, with grand waterfront buildings dressed in alpine shades of blue, buttercup and rose. Don’t miss the car-free, flower-filled old town, Venetian city gates, cobbled main square and baroque fresco-adorned churches. Even the museum, Alto Garda, has extravagant trappings; this medieval fortress was once owned by the powerful Scaliger family. A glance at the restaurant menus reveals specials of schnitzels and strudels, as well as delicious mountain cheeses, cured meats such as mortadella and fruity red wines.</p>
<h3>Exploring Lake Garda</h3>
<p>Boats regularly set off from Riva’s harbour, bound for the villages of Lake Garda. Each one has its own forte. You could visit <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a> and catch the cable car up Monte Baldo, explore Limone’s (you guessed it) lemon growing history, and even sail as far south as castle-topped <a data-udi="umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/93a0ea3cd0334ca088eaf788bad0faba}" title="Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. Hold on to your hat whilst speeding across the lake aboard catamarans and hydrofoils, or choose one of the leisurely ferries that meander through the lake and mountain scenery at a more holiday-like pace.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Plenty of water sports opportunities</h3>
<p>Head to the lakeside and rent out a paddle board or a kayak. This is the best way to get some family bonding time in, there’s nothing better than gliding across the water on a paddle board- for more of a challenge you could even try tandem paddle boarding. Sailing is also a great way to get youngsters trying their hand at something new – the wind conditions in the North of the lake are perfect for watersports, so you won’t struggle to get going!</p>
<h3>Beaches packed with family activities</h3>
<p>If you want a day by the beach then head to the family friendly Sabbioni beach. The beach has a mixture of grassy and shingle sections on the lake shore. It’s a good size so there’s lots of space to spread out and lie down with a good book in the sun. Young teens can head to the trampolines, volleyball and basketball courts or rent a canoe at the rowing club, while parents relax in one of the bars with a drink in hand. For younger children there’s also a playground to burn off some energy!</p>
<h3>Family walking adventures</h3>
<p>There are some fantastic walking spots around Riva which include Monte Brione which has views over Riva and the fjord-like Lake Garda. There are trails up here suited for all walking abilities, so we’d recommend putting on your hiking boots and seeing which paths you can find for a family walk with some incredible views!</p>
<p>Head to the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.cascata-varone.com/en/varone-waterfall-cave-park.htm" target="_blank">Varone Waterfall</a> is an 100 metre high waterfall which you can walk to with the family, stopping off for a picnic along the way this is a fantastic area to walk around and take in some striking natural sites. The Varone Caves are a natural phenomenon which you can walk through on bridges and walkways and gaze in awe at the incredible rock formations surrounding you. It’s surrounded by a small protected nature reserve and there’s even a botanical garden in the park which has been beautifully curated with Mediterranean plants and rare types of vegetation. Why not see how many different types of plant the children can spot as you walk through! To enter the park it costs between €19 - €28 per family, depending on family size.</p>
<h3>Biking around Riva</h3>
<p>Biking is popular in Riva. Again, Monte Brione is a great place to go for a cycle. There are specific cycle paths and paved roads on the mountain so it’s not hard to find an easy biking route that will be suitable for children – there’s a great loop which takes about an hour to complete, which is worth trying out with the family. If you want something more challenging, there are plenty of thrill-seeker mountain biking trails to try your hand at.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Bus</h3>
<p>There are loads of towns to visit on <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> and Riva’s in an ideal position for getting to other northerly towns on the lake. The bus is an affordable way to explore other towns or areas near Riva. Why not head over to <a data-udi="umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c}" title="Limone">Limone</a> which is famous for its quaint cobbled streets and cosy atmosphere, it only takes 15 minutes on the bus (LN027). Alternatively take a day trip to Lake Ledro which is a hidden gem just 35 minutes from Riva on the B214 bus. Spend the day there and discover even more of what the Italian lake district has to offer – the walking there is also fantastic. Or, if you’re staying in one of our hotels which are further from Riva’s centre such as the <a data-udi="umb://document/3566c3c4f3024dac8793ab30719f7066" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3566c3c4f3024dac8793ab30719f7066}" title="Hotel Du Lac Et Du Parc">Hotel du Lac e du Parc</a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/5cdbdffcbd3f413496166a1214d6740d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/5cdbdffcbd3f413496166a1214d6740d}" title="Hotel Villa Nicolli Romantic Resort">Villa Nicolli</a> and don’t fancy the walk, then you can always hop on the bus to the centre of town, the journey takes about 7 minutes.</p>
<h3>Ferry</h3>
<p>The ferries from Riva are great for hopping to other towns around Lake Garda. You can get all the way from the North to the South of the lake directly, so why not take a day trip to somewhere like Garda, or perhaps stop off somewhere in between, like Limone or Malcesine. Head to Limone on the ferry and walk back along the Ponale trail which links Limone and Riva – this is a stunning panoramic trail to try out. Or, take advantage of even more walking opportunities on Monte Baldo in Malcesine. You can check out the ferry timetables on the <a href="https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/">Navigazione Laghi website</a>.</p>]]></gettingAround>

<h3>The Ponale Way<strong> (Riva to Pregasina)</strong></h3>
<p>Walk to Lake Ledro and explore a hidden gem for the day; why not visit Lake Ledro’s Pile Dwelling Museum? The Ponale Way was originally created to link Lake Garda and Lake Ledro, and to connect Ledro to the rest of the Trentino region. You can take a beautiful walk along the route from Riva to Pregasina or you can fork off towards Lake Ledro. Both options are fantastic and will give you the chance to have a drink or a bite to eat when you finish the trail. At the end you can either head back on the bus or walk back. The Ponale Way is abundant in incredible views of Lake Garda and flanked by limestone-white rock face for some of the way and walking along raised asphalt paths for other legs of the journey. This route is one of the most famous in Northern Lake Garda and whilst it is a relaxed walk it has some of the most fantastic panoramic routes in the whole of Lake Garda, which a panoramic trail which has been carved into the rocks, leading through small tunnels and forested sections.</p>

<h3>Monte Corno and Busa dei Capitani</h3>
<p>Starting in Riva’s neighbouring town of Torbole this easy circular walk passes by strongholds of the First World War on the Austro-Hungarian front line. It’s a great walk for history buffs, as it showcases military ruins, including trenches, artillery stations. The area is known as the Busa dei Capitani and has fantastic views of the Lake flanked by ancient fortified walls.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>The Varone Waterfall, Caves and Nature Reserve</h3>
<p>Not a walking route as such, but the Cascate del Varone (Varone Waterfalls), the Nature Reserve and caves are wonderful places to walk around, particularly with a family. There are all manner of rare Mediterranean plants in the nature reserve, which you can admire from specially curated pathways. If you enter the caves (payable locally), it’s like walking through a labyrinth of underground tunnels, cocooned by damp rocks and jagged walls. You’ll be expecting a Minotaur to jump out at any second! We love taking a picnic to the waterfall and watching the water cascading down the rocks, whilst chomping on sandwiches and planning your next holiday activity.</p>
<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> You can head up on the bus which takes about 15 minutes (B861) or you can walk up which takes around 45 minutes.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Beautiful Riva is Lake Garda’s most northerly town – where Lake Garda and the Alps meet]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Things to see and do</h3>
<p>There’s lots to see and do in Riva. We love the town’s historic, pebbled square. You can spend a few hours in the boutiques picking up some souvenirs or just grab a table outside and order a drink while you enjoy the atmosphere. Dive deeper into Riva’s history by visiting the Museo Alto Garda. It’s in an ancient medieval castle and has exhibits dedicated to archaeology, paintings and life around Lake Garda in the past. It’s great for little ones too with lots of hands-on experiences. Plus, you get some of the best views of the lake from the tower.</p>
<p>It’s easy to explore from Riva, too. Ferries will run to nearby towns like <a data-udi="umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce" href="/{localLink:umb://document/89a5238595c34e53a5ef4c989b459fce}" title="Malcesine">Malcesine</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/604dbba59ac64320ab6e9f1e89231a4c}" title="Limone">Limone</a>. If you want to escape the crowds for a while, we can recommend going to <a data-udi="umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b}" title="Lake Ledro">Lake Ledro</a>. It’s just half an hour away by bus and the waters there are some of the best for swimming.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Riva caters well for walkers of all abilities. There’s something so relaxing about taking lakeside walks here – they’re nice and flat and you can walk for miles. The walk to nearby Torbole is particularly nice and you stop there for lunch before walking back. You need to head higher for some of the best scenery though. Strada del Ponale is our favourite trail for bird’s eye views of the town and lake.</p>
<p>The north of Lake Garda has some of the best cycling trails in Europe. Challenge yourself with the steep routes down Monte Altissimo that has the famous ex-Seicentouno. It’s not for the faint-hearted! There’s plenty of less scary options too. They involve gentle rides along the lake and heading up hills for beautiful views.</p>
<p>Windsurfing is very popular in Riva and you can normally see it taking place from the piazza. Get involved and try it for yourself, there’s plenty of places locally to book lessons or rent equipment. If you’d rather relax then sit yourself down on the white pebble beach. It’s a popular spot for swimmers and sun bathing.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p><strong>Hiking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains and lakes are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help them stay that way, and remain enjoyable and safe places for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>

<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:</li>
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Riva</h3>
<p>Riva is abundant in history, nature and full of walking opportunities. Monte Brione is right on your doorstep in Riva and a real gem when it comes to walking to those Lake Garda heights. Take in the fjord-like landscape of the Lake from its’ most northerly point, where lakes and mountains meet. There are some beautiful family-friendly trails, such as the paths around the Varone Waterfall and Nature Reserve, where you can walk in and out of ancient caves or stroll through paths lined with rare Mediterranean vegetation. There are also trails that take you out of Riva; ideal for a day trip. The Ponale Way is one of our favourites and follows a path which takes you all the way to <a data-udi="umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b}" title="Lake Ledro">Lake Ledro</a>, Riva’s smaller neighbour; it’s a more challenging route, but with fantastic views of the lake and flanked for some of the way by the limestone-white rock face.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
