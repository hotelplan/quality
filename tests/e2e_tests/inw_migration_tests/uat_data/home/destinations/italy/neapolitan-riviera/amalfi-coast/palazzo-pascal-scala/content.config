  <description><![CDATA[<p>Palazzo Pascal is a perfect little oasis, high in the hills above Ravello. The views from here are wonderful – the hotel’s surrounded by terraces with olive groves and vines and it has some of the best sea views in the area. There’ll be no doubt in your mind that you’re on the Amalfi Coast when you stay here. We love the traditional interiors of the hotel. They’ve paid attention to every detail and the painted ceramic tiles on the floor are produced by the owners own local ceramic business, a popular trade in this region of Italy. If you fancy taking back a few souvenirs, you can head to their shop in Ravello.</p>
<p>There’s only seven bedrooms here, which gives the hotel a great authentic feel. Get the know the other guests over breakfast, which is served on the terrace. Take your time to linger over your coffee and enjoy the sea views. There’s a small pool with loungers and a views of the steps that’ll get you to Ravello if you’re feeling energetic. The hotel itself is actually in Scala, a little village above Ravello. This means you’ll get to escape the crowds when you want to relax.</p>
<p>We can highly recommend the hotel’s restaurant, Gli Ulivi. Make sure you try the fresh seafood dishes! The whole menu is bursting with locally sourced ingredients. Some of the vegetables and herbs are even are grown on the hotel’s terraces. It’s about ten minutes’ walk to the nearest shops and restaurants in the village of Scala, and Ravello is a short bus ride away, as are all the rest of the Amalfi Coast towns.</p>
<p>Transfer time: approx. 1 hour 20 mins by private car from Naples airport.</p>]]></description>

  <facilityDescription><![CDATA[<p><strong><u>Pools &amp; Beaches</u></strong></p>
<p>The swimming pool is on the terrace, where you'll find comfortable sun loungers the look out over the spectacular view. </p>
<p>There's a few beaches to choose from nearby that can be reached by bus or you can take the steep trails down to them. <span>If you're up for a walk, take the downward trail from the Villa to Atrani. It takes about two hours, but there's a lovely fresh spring on route where you can cool off. At the end of the trail you'll find the unspoiled beach and little town of Atrani, where you can have a refreshing swim and a bite to eat. The beach has lots of loungers that you can pay locally to use for the day. There's a bus that will take you back up to Scala if you don't fancy the uphill hike.</span></p>
<p>You'll also find the spaggia di Ravello, just east of Atrani where there's a smaller <span>100 metre stretch of sand surrounded by the dramatic cliffs that Ravello is perched above coast or to the west is the main beach in Amalfi. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Activities</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>“Nonna Maria” cooking class</strong> where you'll be introduced to authentic Italian cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Wine Experience </strong>where you'll discover the local DOC wines like <span>Tramonti, those of Ravello and the whites of Furore.</span> Under the guidance of an expert sommelier you'll learn about the different methods of production in the region, as you taste the authentic flavours of wine and food in the area. <span id="more-143"></span></p>
<p>These experiences are bookable locally or directly with the hotel, subject to availability. </p>
<p><strong>Amalfi Coast Walking Trails </strong>can be reached straight from Palazzo Pascal. The quiet countryside location means that you’ll find some of the fantastic walking trails of the Amalfi Coast right on your doorstep. Some of them will lead you down to the beaches on the coast and others up along the steep terraces, where you can take in the spectacular views. Note that some of the trails involve lots of steep paths and steps. Be sure to head out prepared with good walking shoes, water and check the weather before you leave. </p>

  <listingDescription><![CDATA[<p>We love this small and intimate hotel on the Amalfi Coast. It's in a quiet setting in the hills above Ravello - the sea views from up here are amazing. There's a nice pool area and traditionally-styled rooms with pieces of ceramic from the owner's local business. There's only seven rooms here so you'll feel very comfortable and well taken care of. </p>]]></listingDescription>
