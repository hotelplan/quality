  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Hop on the Seceda Gondola and discover hundreds of walking trails</li>
<li>Scope out traditional wood carved sculptures in the town</li>
<li>Learn some of the local dialect, Ladin</li>
</ul>
<p>Ortisei – or Urtijëi, as it’s better known in the local language of Ladin – is a Tyrolean town in the heart of the Val Gardena. This is a community that’s forged Olympic bobsledders, skiers and figure skaters – outdoorsy folk who don’t stop just because the snow has melted off the mountains. Instead, they spend their summers on the walking and cycling paths. On you summer holiday in Ortisei, you’ll be welcomed by a close-knit community, famous for its woodcarving tradition – who will take any excuse for a get-together in one of the many cafés and bars.</p>
<h3>Mountain walking: up and away on the Seceda gondola</h3>
<p>This highly useful gondola carries passengers from Ortisei all the way to the summit of Seceda Mountain. There’s no need to do anything but marvel at the views over the shard-like Odle peaks. But, if you do fancy stretching your legs, miles of walking paths wind through alpine wildflowers and past mountain huts with sun-trap decks. There are also routes down to some of the best mountain biking tracks in the Val Gardena; the opportunities are endless for your summer walking holiday.</p>
<h3>Call me Urtijëi: getting to know Ortisei on your summer holiday</h3>
<p>There are plenty of things to do to keep you busy in Ortisei town. The pedestrianised centre is a sweep of arcaded shops, restaurants, churches and cafés, all bundled up in a colourful alpine palette. Friday evenings are when the streets really come alive, with diners digging into all manner of food and drink from pizzas and gröstl dumplings to Michelin-starred menus late into the night, while bands get toes tapping in the summer. Most of the residents speak Ladin as their first language, so it’s a great idea to learn a few words… and to call Ortisei by its Ladin name of Urtijëi.</p>
<h3>Tradition in the Dolomites: never too early for a Nativity set</h3>
<p>If you think your summer holiday is a strange time to stock up on Nativity sets, then think again. Master woodcarvers have been chipping away in Ortisei since the 15<sup>th</sup> century, passing on skills through the generations. It’s a revered and sacred art in this neck of the woods (pine woods, to be exact), filling churches with decadent altar pieces and shop shelves with souvenir Nativity sets. Go to Gherdëina museum for a whistle-stop tour through the history of woodcarving.</p>
<h3>Exploring nearby towns: buses to Bolzano and beyond</h3>
<p>Buses connect the villages of the Alto Adige. Drop by the neighbouring town of Selva, the high-rise rose gardens of Rosarium Uhrerhof, and Puez-Geisler Nature Park, with its lovely hiking loops and mountain huts with iconic Dolomite views. Buses also head to Bolzano, the provincial capital of South Tyrol. It’s a university city with a cathedral, galleries, squares and parks, all topped off with a lively mountain spirit.</p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Exploring Ortisei and the surrounding area</h3>
<p>Ortisei is in the Val Gardena valley and stretches to the neighbouring resorts of Santa Cristina and Selva. The town's pedestrianised streets are full of shops and cafés, perfect for perusing. The Rosarium Uhrerhof, Europe's highest rose garden, is close by and has over 6,000 rose bushes with great views overlooking the town. Head up on the walking lifts to explore the Dolomite mountains on foot or an e-bike; it's a great way to see the landscape from a different perspective.</p>
<h3>Traditional food &amp; drink </h3>
<p>In the Val Gardena region of Italy there are too many tasty treats to mention but our favourite is grostl, which are dumplings stuffed with meat and potatoes. The area’s known for serving up traditional Ladin meals and if you want to splash out, the Michelin starred restaurant Anna Stuben is great for a special dinner; just make sure you book well in advance. When out and about on your walks, stop off in one of the mountain huts. They’re the perfect place for a hearty post-walk lunch or enjoying an Aperol Spritz while watching the sun set.</p>
<h3>Mountain activities</h3>
<p>There are loads of walking trails in Ortisei. Our favourite area to explore is the Puez-Geisler natural park. There are some fantastic loops and trails with mountain huts along the way. Head towards the peak of Seceda for the best scenery and photo opportunities. If you fancy taking the easy route up, just hop on the lifts or better yet, rent an e-bike and make a day of it. </p>
<p>For the active family there are some fun activities on offer, including an adventure park and mini-golf. Or, if you want to get your adrenaline pumping, take to the sky on a tandem paragliding session for an incredible bird’s eye view of the area. The Mar Dolomit swimming pool and sauna is another great option, particularly if the weather's bad. Children can spend the day splashing about in the indoor pool whilst adults head to the sauna or massage rooms for a bit of relaxation.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful- you can rent them in resort from around €8 per day.</p>
<p><strong>Walking maps</strong></p>
<p>Val Gardena Outdoor is available for free on <a rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details" target="_blank">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/val-gardena-gr%C3%B6den-outdoor/id1185520171">App Store</a> and has quite a few walks on there to get you started. For paper maps, we recommend Kompass 59 or Kompass 76.</p>
<p><strong>Walking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>

<h3>Why we love walking in Ortisei</h3>
<p>Ortisei is perfectly set up for walking and exploring the outdoors. There are so many different landscapes to discover in the Val Gardena, from meadows and farms, to lakes and rocky mountain routes. It's also a great place for spotting local wildlife such as, horses, cows and even marmots!</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
