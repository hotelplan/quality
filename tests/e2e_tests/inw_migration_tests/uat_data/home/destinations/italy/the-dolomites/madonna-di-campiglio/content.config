  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Stroll through a 'chocolate-box' town centre</li>
<li>Treat yourself to Michelin-starred meals</li>
<li>Walk up to waterfalls and spend the day by biotope lakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Discover Madonna di Campiglio in the Brenta Dolomites. Its traditional architecture and glacial river have helped it earn its nickname, 'Pearl of the Dolomites'. Walk through cobbled streets and soak up the rustic mountain architecture; with balconies adorned with brightly coloured flower boxes and buildings frescoed with stories of local life. You'll love this 'chocolate-box' mountain village.</p>
<h3>Walking in and around Trentino- from waterfalls to biotope lakes</h3>
<p>The Brenta Dolomites are famous for their waterfalls, you can head up to the Nardis falls in Val Genova, about 30 minutes in a car or walk there, which takes about 4 hours. If you're looking to head further afield you could head to Lake Idro Biotope lake for the day. It takes about 2 hours 30 minutes on the bus or you can cycle there along the 57km cycle path that connects it with the Brenta Dolomites. Lake Idro is full of different plant and animal species, including many types of water fowl, including the Great Crested Glebe. There's also a good walking trail around the lake, or if biking's more up your street, the paths are ideal for a bike. Although Lake Idro is one of the smallest of the Pre-Alpine lakes, it's also the highest, it has very interesting biological and geographical significance.</p>
<h3>Family time in Madonna di Campiglio</h3>
<p>In the town centre you'll find play parks for children to blow off steam in and there are lots of family walks to enjoy. Scope out the trails either in the valley and along the river or up in the mountains, through meadows and along easy pathways. From tennis to boules, golf, swimming, canyoning, padel, volleyball and even orienteering there's so much on offer to keep teens and young ones out of trouble on their summer holiday. Looking for an adrenaline rush? Try out canyoning; glide down the waterfalls and steep slopes of the Palvico river in Storo or wade through a ravine in Val Brenta- a fun day out for older children.</p>
<h3>Delicious Trentino food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>If artisanal food culture is your thing then Madonna has a lot to offer you. They even have a local artisanal chocolate maker. The Roccati family own two exclusive chocolate boutiques, one in Madonna and the other in none other than Bologna, the food capital of Italy! They see chocolate making as an art and tasting their chocolate is a real treat and local treasure. What's the perfect complement to chocolate? Wine of course! In nearby Pinzolo there's an historical wine cellar called Alimentari Caola, which is particularly popular for its sparkling wines; perfect for a holiday celebration. The shop also sells local cheeses, honey, jams and grappa; all from within a zero kilometre zone, to support the local community and economy. If you want a taste of the real Trentino, this is a great place to go. </p>
<p>If you're really looking to push the boat out on your summer holiday, Madonna has two Michelin Starred restaurants; Il Gallo Cedrone and La Stube Hermitage at Bio Hotel Hermitage. Il Gallo Cedrone offers a taste of local produce, from smoked hams and typical cheeses to freshwater fish from the Trentino region. La Stube Hermitage on the other hand, puts its own creative spin on traditional dishes, making them new, fresh and exciting.</p>
<h3>Biking in around Madonna di Campiglio</h3>
<p>As with many mountain resorts, biking is one of the most popular activities in Madonna di Campiglio. The road cycling race from the Brenta Dolomites to Lake Garda is part of the annual Top Dolomites Outdoor Festival that takes place in early June each year. Get your cycle on and hire some bikes from a shop in town, and head off for a sightseeing adventure on two wheels! Cycle along the riverside or hop on a gondola and take your bikes up the mountain for access to some fantastic mountain scenery and routes.</p>
<h3>Natural History of the Brenta Dolomites</h3>
<p>Did you know that the Brenta Dolomites and the Rendina Valley were once all under water? There are various parts of the valley where you'll find stones and fossils which date back to the Mesozoic era (around 200 million years ago!). The geography of the mountains around here suggests that the area was once primarily glaciers. Nowadays, the glaciers have shrunk so much they're now less than half the size they were 100 years ago.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Family activities</h3>
<p>Madonna di Campiglio prides itself on being a great destination for a family summer holiday, so it has loads of fun activities on offer to keep children and adults entertained on their summer holiday. From tennis to boules, golf, swimming, canyoning, padel, volleyball, vie ferrate, and even orienteering; children will never get bored! Spend some time in the outdoor playground which sits near the glacial river, it has a grassy area where you can take picnics whilst keeping an eye on the little ones. Cycling with young ones is also a great option as there are a few well kept cycle paths which you can hop on and off from Madonna; try out the Val Rendena Cycle Path or the floral cycle path which links the Brenta Dolomites to Lake Idro.</p>
<h3>Spot of Rain? No problem! Things to do when the sun isn't shining</h3>
<p>When the sun has gone in and the rain clouds have come out, there's still plenty to keep you and your children busy in Madonna. Indoor golf is always great fun and a great family bonding activity, head to the Campiglio Golf Academy and test out your golfing skills. If you head to Pinzolo there's an indoor Olympic sized ice-skating rink where you carve up the ice and have family races from one end of the rink to the other. The Palestra in Madonna di Campiglio offers tonnes of activities, from rock climbing walls, to volley ball, handball and basketball courts, where children can blow off some of that bad weather steam.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>Hop on the bus from Madonna to travel around the Trentino region. Buses are useful for travelling further afield to attractions and other walking areas such as Lake Idro. The local B231 bus to the nearby town of Pinzolo takes about half an hour and the same bus line also takes you to St Antonio di Mavignola which takes about 15 minutes. Grabbing a bus to one of these nearby towns will open up even more walking opportunities for you.</p>
<h3>Cable Cars</h3>
<p>Open from June to September the summer lift network in Madonna is fantastic for winching you up the mountain, to get you closer to those Brenta Dolomite and valley views. If you fancy lunch on the mountain, hop on a lift and find a typical mountain rifugio/hut and grab a taste of the local food. In the summer months the lifts tend to open at 8.30am and stay open until around 5pm, with a two hour afternoon break for lunch, usually between 12.50-2pm (timings are lift dependant). For more information about the lift timings visit the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.campigliodolomiti.it/en/skiarea-estiva/lifts-summer-opening-program" target="_blank">Madonna di Campiglio official website</a>.</p>
<h3>Cycle paths</h3>
<p>The 57 kilometre long cycle path connecting the Brenta Dolomites to Lake Idro is an attraction in itself and a lovely way of heading to nearby areas. It passes through the Val Rendena and the Valle del Chiese (Church Valley). The path is also known as the Ciclovia dei Fiori (the cycle path of flowers) because of the diverse plant species that grow next it in spring and summer. In 2024 the route won the Italian Green Road award, for keeping the balance between the natural and human world.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Biking in Madonna di Campiglio</h3>
<p>Madonna is a great place for biking enthusiasts in the summer. The 57km long Brenta Dolomites to Lake Idro cycle path also known as the Ciclopista dei Fiori (the cycle path of flowers) connects Madonna to Lake Idro. The path is a lovely way of heading to nearby areas. It passes through the Val Rendena and the Valle del Chiese (Church valley). Also known as the Ciclovia dei Fiori (the cycle path of flowers) because of the diverse plant species that grow next it in spring and summer. In 2024 the route won the Italian Green Road award, for keep a balance between the natural and human world.</p>
<h3>Exploring nearby lakes</h3>
<p>There's a great selection of lakes around Madonna di Campiglio which are lovely to take a picnic to on a sunny day, or walk around. Lake Nambino has a lovely alpine hut where you can grab a drink and a bite to eat whilst gazing out over the crystal clear water. You can cycle here in about 20 minutes from the town or walk there in about an hour. Lake Montagnoli is also worth a visit if you want an easy lakeside walk or to take a dip surrounded by alpine forests. It's a great one for families and a natural sun trap; perfect for soaking up some rays and the water has an incredible aquamarine colour.</p>
<p>Head over to Lake Ritorto with its gentle mountain walls which you can walk or cycle to. There are some lovely walks which take you past several of the lakes around Madonna, for example the Five Lakes Tour. If you fancy checking out as many lakes as you can on your summer holiday it's worth doing a bit of research before you go.</p>
<p>You could also try out one of our multi-centre holidays where we've paired Madonna di Campiglio with <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ee16f6b7f5224e5c8d9b68f1d4b62c0b}" title="Lake Ledro">Lake Ledro</a>!</p>
<h3>Walking to waterfalls and beyond</h3>
<p>The Brenta Dolomites is famous for its waterfalls. Walk along the Sentiero dell'Orso (Bear Path) to the Vallesinella Waterfalls, which are the most famous waterfalls in the Adamello-Brenta Natural Park. The trail starts by the Spinale Gondola station, and heads through forests all the way up to the highest of the waterfalls, the Malga Valesinella di Sopra. Or, you could spend the day enjoying a picnic in the stunning Val Nambrone, where you can scope out the Cascata Amola. You can walk to the falls from the Rifugio Val Nambrone which you can get to by heading to the next door town of Pinzolo.</p>
<h3>Visit Museums around Madonna di Campiglio</h3>
<p>There's no shortage of history in the Trentino region, and if you want to explore the history of the area and learn something new, why not head to one of the many museums in the area. The Museum of Campiglio Mountain Guides and People, will take you on an historical journey through the lives of alpine pioneers and mountaineers, who were some of the first people to discover the Brenta Dolomites. If war history is more up your street, you may want to check out the <a rel="noopener" href="https://museoguerraspiazzo.it/" target="_blank">Adamello Front War Museum</a> in Spiazza, which can be reached by bus in around 40 minutes.
