<h3>Discover the Dolomites</h3>
<p>The Dolomites are our favourite playground. There's a near limitless number of activities you can do here from walking to cycling, mountain biking, e-biking, mountain climbing, historic tours, farm visits and wine tasting. It's also known for being one of Europe's most beautiful mountain ranges - no wonder it's UNESCO protected. Pack your walking boots and head off to discover some of the best views in the world.</p>
<h3>Walking holidays in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>A walking holiday in the Dolomites is all about the views. Head out at sunrise or sunset and you'll be rewarded with some picture-perfect scenes when the jagged mountain tops get a reddish glow. The trails are easy to access with a great network of lifts taking you to the tops of the mountains. Hike up the famous Piz Boe mountain from Corvara or enjoy leisurely walks with stunning views in the Val Gardena valley when staying in Selva.</p>
<h3>Things to do in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>Holidays to the Dolomites are like nowhere else due to the towering mountains and historical castles poking out of the landscape, some dating back to 1300AD. The public transport and network of lifts means exploring the area couldn't be easier. You can even head to the beautiful city of Bolzano for a day out.</p>
<p>Throughout the year there's always something going on. Expect anything from the traditional markets in Ortisei selling hand crafted goods, to the singing and dancing at the Ladin folk festival in Canazei.  </p>
<h3>Activities in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to activities in the Dolomites. The cycling's fantastic with rugged trails perfect for mountain bikers (or hire an e-bike to help you get up those hills). Adrenaline junkies should try their hand at via ferrata, paragliding, or rafting. If you’d rather take it easier, you can play a round of golf, head to a thermal spa, or sample some of the region’s wine at a vineyard.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>One of the best things about a holiday in the Dolomites is filling up on the food and wine. It's one of the best regions in Italy for food, with the most Michelin-starred restaurants and plenty of local specialties.</p>
<p>It’s not just restaurants in resort serving up delicious food. All over the Dolomites you'll find mountain huts offering a wide range of dishes. We highly recommend trying local food such as 'speck', a smoky mouth-watering cured meat. A real local classic is their dumplings. Perfectly handcrafted, they are flavoured with a variety of ingredients and served in a rich creamy cheese sauce. For dessert, they serve up a mean apple strudel.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>The Dolomites are perfect for an active family holiday. There’s plenty of walking trails for kids and teens to explore, and they can get involved in all the activities, too. Lots of resorts offer child-friendly active programmes, and when they’ve burned off enough energy in the mountains, head for a hut to refuel or laze poolside to catch some rays.</p>

  <foodAndDrink><![CDATA[<p>The relatively small area of South Tyrol in the Dolomites is packed with Michelin starred restaurants. In fact, it has more than any other region in Italy! New stars are being awarded every year, which is a great excuse to keep returning. The cuisine here is influenced by <a data-udi="umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a1a80922d88a43f8ba80b182c72e8904}" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760}" title="Austria">Austria</a>, so expect dishes like apple strudel (made from the fresh apples that grow in the hills), polenta and hearty dumplings. Regional specialties include speck (cured ham) and panicia (pearl barley with water and milk).</p>
<p>You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to award-winning wines in the Dolomites. Reds, whites and sparkling – whatever your favourite is you’re guaranteed to find it here. With only 9% of the region below 1,500 metres, the vines are packed into around 4,900 hectares. Many of these are still family-owned and follow old traditions to harvest the grapes. Stay in <a data-udi="umb://document/c5c478381e04431da3f69d8364215ae7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c5c478381e04431da3f69d8364215ae7}" title="Merano">Merano</a> and you can visit these wineries to see how the wine is produced and stock up on some bottles to take home.</p>]]></foodAndDrink>

The public transport and network of lifts means exploring the area couldn't be easier. You can even head to the beautiful city of Bolzano for a day out.</p>

Expect anything from the traditional markets in <a data-udi="umb://document/a7a8ad5233804c39b1e02e8dd02cc1fc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a7a8ad5233804c39b1e02e8dd02cc1fc}" title="Ortisei">Ortisei</a> selling hand crafted goods, to the singing and dancing at the Ladin folk festival in <a data-udi="umb://document/7075240655bf40a19a9c77b24d8c5082" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7075240655bf40a19a9c77b24d8c5082}" title="Canazei">Canazei</a>.   </p>
<p>No matter where you are in the Dolomites, you might be lucky enough to witness a natural phenomenon while on holiday. As the sunsets in the Dolomites, a red glow appears over the mountains peaks, known locally as Enrosadira. Truly a spectacular site. </p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink </h3>
<p>Italy is <span>renowned</span> for amazing food and we know all the best places in the Dolomites. Nearly every resort sells freshly made stone baked pizzas and home-made lasagne with recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. If you want a holiday based around great food, <a data-udi="umb://document/c5c478381e04431da3f69d8364215ae7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c5c478381e04431da3f69d8364215ae7}" title="Merano">Merano</a> is the place to go. Not only is food grown locally but due to the Mediterranean climate, wine comes from the orchards sat above the Alpine town.</p>
<p>It's not just restaurants in resort serving up delicious food. All over the Dolomites you'll find mountain huts offering a wide range of dishes. We highly recommend trying local grub such as 'speck', a smoky mouth-watering cured meat. A real local classic is their dumplings. Perfectly handcrafted, they are flavoured with a variety of ingredients and served in a rich creamy cheese sauce. For dessert the Italians use their links with Austria and serve up a mean apple strudel.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Throughout the resorts we feature in the Dolomites, you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to walking and cycling. Hike up the famous Piz Boe mountain from <a data-udi="umb://document/2dcd6a7190a6406da6015eb2825945d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2dcd6a7190a6406da6015eb2825945d1}" title="Corvara &amp; Colfosco">Corvara</a> or enjoy leisurely walks with stunning views in the Val Gardena valley when staying in <a data-udi="umb://document/4c9fc09241f14e3c80acb89b5c9226dd" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4c9fc09241f14e3c80acb89b5c9226dd}" title="Selva">Selva</a>. It's here you will also find cycling haven 'Trail Arena'. It has some of the best facilities for anyone on two wheels. Pretty much in all of the resorts you can hire a bike but if your not sure you can cope with the hills, upgrade to an e-bike, we did and it was the best.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a resort with lots of fun activities, we found <a data-udi="umb://document/bffd76f3b2734cdbb2a66c10b923aaef" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bffd76f3b2734cdbb2a66c10b923aaef}" title="Kronplatz">Kronplatz</a> certainly had loads going on. You can go on a segway tour, play a round of golf, even go rafting or kayaking. However if you want an adrenalin rush, you need to try the Skyscraper! Across many of the resorts is the chance to try a tandem paragliding experience. If you don't mind heights it's a great way to see the area from above and gets some pictures and memories to treasure forever. Head to our resort pages to find out more about each resort.</p>]]></inAround>
