  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Savour local wine in an ancient vineyard</li>
<li>Walk around incredible botanical gardens</li>
<li>Enjoy an evening of live music at the Kurhaus music hall</li>
</ul>
<p>Merano is a favoured Italian summer holiday destination and a culturally rich town known for its radon springs and spas. Sitting in a beautiful South Tyrolean basin surrounded by mountains, it has medieval arcades, castles and churches dating back to the 12th century. In summer the mountains come alive with colourful wildflowers, crystal-clear streams and verdant vineyards and forests. Whether you're walking or just relaxing in one of the town’s many parks or its botanical gardens, the views are breath-taking.</p>
<h3>Luxury in Merano: a royal flush</h3>
<p>Once visited by Austrian royals, Merano became a popular summer retreat among the European bourgeoisie in the 19th century, and has beautiful hotels and architecture to show for it. Today you can follow in the footsteps of the 19th century elite by walking in the foothills, lazing in the many spas and exploring the incredible Trauttmansdorff Castle botanical gardens, which you can walk to from town on the famous Sissi's Path.</p>
<h3>A relaxing retreat: thermal spa therapy</h3>
<p>Merano is famous throughout Italy for its natural hot springs, and there are several thermal spas in the area where you can relax and rejuvenate in the healing waters. Some of the most popular spots include the Terme Merano (the Merano Thermal Baths) and the AquaForum. Summer holidays have never been so regenerating!</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in Merano: centuries of culture (and wine)</h3>
<p>Merano has a rich cultural heritage, with several museums, galleries and historic buildings to explore. The town is particularly well known for its Art Nouveau architecture, which can be seen in buildings like the Kurhaus and Villa Tivoli. If you visit the Castel Rametz, you can explore the ancient wine cellar, said to be the first place to produce wine in the Alps, going all the way back to Roman times. The wine tastings here are fantastic, and you'll also have the chance to try some of the local cured meats with your wine, it's the best way to get a taste of Merano.</p>
<h3>Tyrolean treats: tuck into Merano's local food</h3>
<p>The food might be the best thing of all in Italy’s South Tyrol and a highlight of your summer holiday. Blending Austrian, Italian and Mediterranean influences, traditional Tyrolean dishes include speck (smoked ham), knödel (dumplings) and kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancake) alongside the classic Italian favourites. Wash it all down with a glass of wine from a local vineyard.</p>

You'll get all these included with your free Merano Mobil Card (up to 7 days), so getting around is really affordable and you'll have the freedom to explore even more of the area. What's great about Merano's public buses is that most of them are electric, which is a really positive step in making the air cleaner for generations to come.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Marvellous Merano is the ideal summer holiday destination: a town famous for its vineyards and thermal waters with walking trails heading in every direction]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Relaxing in Merano's thermal baths</h3>
<p>Merano's thermal baths are the perfect place to relax and unwind after a day of walking in the mountains. At the spas you'll find everything from Finish saunas to steam rooms, plus 25 pools, each unique in it's own way. Be sure to make use of the outdoor pools, some of which have wonderful mountain views- dreamy!</p>
<h3>Plenty of summer activities to enjoy</h3>
<p><span>Cycling is a great way to see the area. Dedicated bike paths make it easy for families to head out exploring. Be sure to take your camera to capture the amazing scenery as you go. Or, grab your tennis racket, for a match of tennis on one of Merano's various courts. In the summer you may be lucky enough to stumble on some live music and entertainment, which livens up the streets.</span></p>
<h3>Food &amp; wine in the South Tyrol</h3>
<p><span>This region is well known for its wine thanks to its Mediterranean climate. Orchards and vineyards line the mountains and stretch down to the town. We recommend visiting Castel Rametz, a wine museum where you can take a guided walk around the ancient Roman wine cellar and try the delicious wine. There are also a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Merano as well as local, family-run places, too. Our go-to dish is Schlutzer. It's a traditional handmade ravioli dish stuffed with spinach, onion, nutmeg, and covered in butter - delicious!</span></p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<p><strong>Walking maps &amp; apps</strong></p>
<p>South Tyrol Guide is available for free on <a rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suedtirol.android&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" data-anchor="?id=com.suedtirol.android&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a> or the <a rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/south-tyrol-s%C3%BCdtirol-guide/id339011586" target="_blank">App Store</a> and has quite a few walks on there to get you started. For paper maps, we recommend Kompass 459. </p>
<p><strong>Walking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Merano</h3>
<p>Merano is fantastic if you're looking for a relaxed holiday with a combination of easier and moderate trails to try out. If you want to explore vineyards, botanical gardens and walk along well maintained routes it's ideal. You get a real sense of being on holiday when you can come back from the mountain trails and head straight into the spa to wind-down.</p>
<h3>Inghams guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
