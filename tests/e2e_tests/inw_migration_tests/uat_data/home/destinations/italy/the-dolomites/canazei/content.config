  <description><![CDATA[<p>Canazei (Cianacei in the local language of Ladin) is tucked amongst the sky-scraping peaks of Val di Fassa – including the Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites. Summer lifts winch hikers and cyclists up to the all-you-can-explore buffet of footpaths and mountain top via ferrata routes. Back in town, the pedestrian-friendly streets of Canazei make for a wonderful wander. Duck into inns and restaurants with elaborately carved wooden balconies and pick up souvenirs in farm and wine shops selling Ladin specialities unique to this once-isolated region.</p>
<h3>Walking the Val di Fassa</h3>
<p>Some of the most scenic footpaths in the <a data-udi="umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f7e065ba2a3d40d7893ad1b116880496}" title="The Dolomites">Dolomites</a> traverse Val di Fassa. Thankfully, having the fitness of a mountain goat isn’t always required. Sure, you can trek up Piz Boè, the highest mountain in the Sella group – or you can hop in the cable car to the top for walks without the calf ache. Lake Carezza is an hour’s bus ride away from Canazei – a fairy-tale lake that mirrors the spruce forests and mountains around. Take in its (often very popular) viewpoints before heading out onto the more family-friendly, peaceful paths beyond.</p>
<h3>Giro d’Italia cycling country</h3>
<p>Cable cars and mountain trails lead the way to the Pordoi Pass, where viewpoints offer incredible views over the Dolomites; and the 28 hairpin bends of the Giro d’Italia far, far below. In this region, cyclists can tackle the challenging climbs of the cols, weave through forests on the valley floor, and dive into bike park trails. Many of the cable cars welcome bikes on board, transforming the Marmolada, Sella and Sassolungo mountains into cycling routes for almost every ability.</p>
<h3>Culture in Canazei: Ladin villages</h3>
<p>Val di Fassa is one of the five Ladin valleys in northern Italy. Italian, German and English are all widely spoken here, but most townspeople name Ladin as their first language. Try “bun dé!” for hello and “giulan!” for thank you when exploring the more traditional mountain huts, bars and bakeries in town. These are the places to try Ladin specialities such as fig-filled cajoncie ravioli and the family favourite Tyrolean pancakes piled with blueberry jam. Festivals materialise all summer long too, including the Gran Festa d’istà – when people from all five Ladin valleys get together to celebrate with music, food and dance. The festivals are great for all age groups and a fantastic opportunity to get to know the local culture.</p>
<h3>Summer mountain adventures for families</h3>
<p>From orienteering and e-biking to easy hikes with cable car access – the mountains around Canazei are a great playground for families. Just don’t forget the actual playgrounds, like Fassa Park’s trampolines, paddling pools and bike hire centre. Dòlaondes is the place for zooming down waterslides and swimming in pools with wrap-around views of the Dolomites; along with a spa treatment or two for the grown-ups.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Family friendly walking</h3>
<p>Canazei has plenty of activities for the whole family to enjoy, including lots of family friendly walks. If you're looking for an easier walk for younger children, the Aloch-Pozza route takes just 30 minutes with a spot to stop off and enjoy lunch, children can also enjoy spotting the wooden sculptures of Ladin legends along the way. Or, for an easier route which is slightly longer, check out the Vigo-Vallonga-Tamion-Vigo walk which is around 6.9 kilometres and takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes. There are some uphill points along the way but there's a playground and plenty of benches and tables for a pit stop or a picnic.</p>
<p>For families looking for a challenge, check out the Penia-Lorenx-Vera-Penia route which is a moderate walk. The walk takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes, and is 5 kilometres. The walk is part of an educational trail where children can learn about the origins of water whilst crossing bridges, streams and meadows. </p>
<h3>Activities galore: family fun in the mountains</h3>
<p>The Ladin Museum Fassa offers a modern and interactive museum, plus there are plenty of other museums in the area too. Head to Fora! - Escape Room Val di Fassa, if you're looking for a challenge (perfect for a rainy day, or a break from the sun). For another great rainy day activity, there's a bowling alley in Canazei town which can be enjoyed from the age of five and above.</p>
<p>Make sure you try out the sightseeing train which runs through the centre of Canazei. It's the perfect way to reach the villages between Campitello and Penia for a day of exploring. If you're looking for a more fast paced activity, then an afternoon spent biking is perfect. Mountain biking is plentiful in Canazei, and there are lots of family routes to choose from.</p>
<h3>Aquapark Vidor</h3>
<p>If days spent swimming and relaxing in a spa are more up your street, then 4,000m² of family fun awaits you at Aquapark Vidor, a family and wellness resort. There are indoor and outdoor pools, slides and more! Adults will enjoy the spas and beauty treatments available too.</p>]]></festivals>

</ul>
<p>Head up to Vigo di Fassa and walk to the incredible medieval church of Santa Giuliana (the patron Saint of the valley), dating back to the early 13th Century! If you love history and art it's well worth looking inside the church which houses a couple of 15th Century frescoes and a 16th Century carved wooden altar. Just beneath the church there's a very poignant Austro-Hungarian war cemetery, making this a very peaceful area to visit. This isn't a long walk but there is a bit of a climb to get to the church, however it is still suitable for families and children. There are a few benches dotted through the larch forest that you'll walk through on this circular route, so ideal for having a little pit stop to take in the serene surroundings.</p>

The end of the walk is downhill to Someda, which is just a short walk away from the starting point of the walk in Moena.</p>

Admire the peaceful waters of the Lake surrounded by mountain scenery and alpine trees. End the walk at the Rifugio Castiglioni Marmolada all the way up at 2,057 metres, where you can enjoy views of the lake and relax with a spot of lunch or a cold drink.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Perpetually watched over by the mighty Marmolada, Canazei is a springboard for some of the greatest walking in the Dolomites, reeling in walkers with a head for heights]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p>Canazei's rich history dates back to World War One and you can learn all about the battles that took place with a visit to the Great War Museum. Take time to wonder round the cobbled streets too, there’s always something going on like music concerts and food &amp; wine shows.</p>
<p>Jumping on the lifts is one of the best ways to get out and about. Many of them allow for bikes so you can explore the <span>Sella, Marmolada and Sassolungo mountains by foot or on two wheels. Or just hop on the shuttle train and enjoy a sightseeing tour to Val Contrin.</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the season there's plenty going on from international mountain running to the Ladin folk festival, where locals from all over the Dolomites come together to celebrate their culture. </span></p>
<p><span> After exploring, we love heading for the Doloandes Wellness Centre. With both fun pools and relaxation areas, it's a great way for all the family to have some fun splashing about. </span></p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink </h3>
<p>When on holiday in the Dolomites you have to try out one of the many mountain huts - they're perfect for lunch. You can expect traditional Ladin recipes with many of the ingredients being sourced locally. Visit as many as you can to try lots of different dishes and unique views of the Dolomites. </p>
<p>There are plenty of places for a drink in Canazei but if you like your wine, visit the Valentini Wine &amp; Speciality Shop. They've got a great selection and you can stock up on snacks like cheese and homemade strudel too.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>There's loads of great walking near Canazei including the Strada die Russi (The Road of the Russians). It's a nice easy two hour walk and the perfect way to warm up the legs at the start of your holiday. Advanced walks  includes climbing up the Piz Boe, the highest mountain of the Sella group with an elevation of 3,152 meters.</p>
<p>Take a trip to the Dolomiti Action Adventure Park in Campitello di Fassa or the Adventure Park Piciocaa in Pozza di Fassa to learn or test your skills along aerial zip lines, Tibetan and Nepalese swinging bridges and suspended rope passages.</p>
<p>Cycling is massive in Canazei, with over 400 routes to explore. One of the most popular goes through the Fassa and Fiemme valleys and along the River Avisio.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
