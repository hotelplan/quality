  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Savour local food in trattorias, traditional farmhouses and mountain rifugi</li>
<li>Learn about pre-historic wildlife at the Museum Ladin Ursus ladinicus</li>
<li>Walk through forests on the Larch Trail</li>
</ul>
<p>The mountain village of San Cassiano lounges between the Lavarela and Conturines peaks of the Alta Badia – a lively ski region that transforms into a laid-back hikers’ haven in summer. Active folk pilgrimage here from all over the world to spend their days walking, cycling, rock climbing and practising yoga in the crystal-clear mountain air. Come evening, you don’t need to look further than the town centre, where restaurants range from no-nonsense trattorias to gourmet eateries. This is also where you’ll find the walking lift that whisks you up to the mountain plateau for an aperitivo with a view; perfect for your summer walking holiday in the Dolomites.</p>
<h3>Introducing: summer in San Cassiano</h3>
<p>At barely a kilometre long from top to toe, it’s easy to get to know San Cassiano (or San Ćiascian, in the local language of Ladin). Its roads smooth out along the green valley floor, leading between timber inns and eateries. San Cassiano church seems to mirror the mountains around, with its limestone cap, snow-white walls and finery-filled insides. There’s even a Wednesday food market – check out the salami and olive oil stalls – and the summertime concerts.</p>
<h3>Walking amongst larches, lakes and limestone peaks</h3>
<p>For an easy summer walk, head for the Path of the Larches, which loops around the – you guessed it – larch forests just north of San Cassiano, passing by water mills and stone-walled farms. It’s an easy route to some spectacular Dolomite views. The neighbouring Fanes-Senes-Braies Natural Park is also best seen from its footpaths. From here, you can walk to peaks and high mountain meadows, or you could do a more moderate walk to the mirrored waters of Lago Lagazuoi or the slab-like peaks of Brunecker Turm; both of which can be reached by cable car. Alternatively, swap boots for bikes on one of the many mountainous cycling routes.</p>
<h3>Tasting mountain food &amp; wine</h3>
<p>San Cassiano might be small, but the food scene is mighty. Farmhouse restaurants and trattorias cook up rich mountain dishes like spinach ravioli (cajincí te ega) and apple pancakes (pössl da pom). The bakeries and delis are the best place for a cappuccino and the Dolomites’ signature bomboloni alla crema doughnuts. Go in search of rare wines from small vineyards in the Tyrol and the delicious mountain food found in traditional rifugi (mountain huts). “Bun pro!”, as they say in Ladinia.</p>
<h3>History in the Dolomites: Ursus ladinicus, the bear bones</h3>
<p>You never know what you might find while walking in the mountains around San Cassiano. In 1987, a local hiker exploring Conturines Cave made the headlines by stumbling across the remains of 12 prehistoric bears. The reconstructed skeletons are now at home in the Museum Ladin Ursus ladinicus in San Cassiano. Over three floors, discover how archaeologists pieced together this previously unknown species of cave bear, while learning more about the intriguing geography and geology of the Dolomites.</p>

<p>All our hotels are within walking distance to a nearby cable car, making it easy to head up into the mountains and start walking straight away.

You'll walk through grassy meadows, which are lovely underfoot and through shaded woodlands. You’ll cross bridges over streams and listen to the gentle trickling of water as you head to the bottom of the dominating Sella Massif. The Sella Massif is the Dolomite mountain range that towers above you and will be a great contrast to the gentle meadows and streams you’ll pass along the walk. This is when you’ll find the Pisciadú Waterfall which rushes down over the mountain rocks. This is a gentle walk, ideal for families, or a relaxed moment to enjoy the nature surrounding you.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[In the summer, laid-back San Cassiano is full of surprises, from mountain history to traditional food and wine]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p>Set beneath a dramatic mountain backdrop, you could easily spend your summer holiday meandering around the pedestrianised streets of San Cassiano taking pictures. Nearby is La Villa, a lovely place to spend a day, and whilst in the area, visit Castle Colz and the old manor house. The historic 16th century building overlooks La Villa and is an impressive site to behold. </p>
<h3>Exploring mountain landscapes: swap the car for cable cars</h3>
<p>Buttercup-yellow cable cars climb from San Cassiano and up into the mountains behind. From the top, you can wander alpine trails or search out a mountain hut for an Hugo spritz (that’s elderflower syrup, mint and prosecco). From here, you can return to San Cassiano – or take the cable car to the neighbouring village of La Villa, with its 16<sup>th</sup>-century castle and famed slalom slopes. Hopping on the cable car to Corvara is another great day out, especially if you fancy tasting some of the best gelato in the Alta Badia.</p>
<h3>Local mountain food &amp; drink </h3>
<p>There are a wide range of local restaurants to discover in San Cassiano, from down-to-earth farmhouses to fine dining establishments. Traditional local dishes such as Schlutzkrapfen (handmade ravioli filled with spinach) shouldn't be missed. It's a simple dish but delicious and a great way to finish off a long mountain walk. </p>
<p>There are a few bars in town but for a tipple with a view, head up the lifts and stop in one of the mountain huts. The South Tyrolean region produces a great selection of red, white and sparkling wines, so there’s plenty of choice when it comes to local labels to try.</p>
<h3>Activities in San Cassiano</h3>
<p>There are loads of leisurely walks starting from San Cassiano, which are all the more beautiful in the summer sun. Head through meadows and along scenic mountain trails. For more challenging hikes, the Fanes-Senes-Braies Natural Park and the trails around Lago Lagazuoi are the places to go. Further afield the famous Dolomite Sella Group is a stunning set of mountains that are well worth a visit. The views from Brunecker Turm are particularly good, so don't forget to take your camera. Cycling is another a great way to explore the area. Either take to the mountains or head over to neighbouring resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/2dcd6a7190a6406da6015eb2825945d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2dcd6a7190a6406da6015eb2825945d1}" title="Corvara &amp; Colfosco">Corvara</a> for the day and enjoy a refreshing gelato or Aperol Spritz.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in San Cassiano</h3>
<p>When you’re up in the Dolomite mountains, everywhere you look is absolutely incredible. From walking at sunrise or sunset and catching the famous 'enrosadira'; when the sun hits the peaks in such a way that they emanate a pinky-orange glow, to stopping off for a typical Tyrolean lunch in a rustic mountain hut. Whether you’re new to walking, and just love strolling through sublime mountain settings, or you’re an expert hiker looking to scale challenging peaks and push yourself to the limit in pursuit of a rare viewpoint, San Cassiano's got you covered.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
