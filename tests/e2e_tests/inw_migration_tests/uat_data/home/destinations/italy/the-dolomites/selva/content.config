  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Explore jagged peaks along hundreds of kilometres of walking trails</li>
<li>Enjoy local food and drink at traditional mountain rifugi</li>
<li>Take in incredible mountain views and pretty village vistas</li>
</ul>
<p>Selva is one of three villages in the famous Val Gardena in the Dolomites. These mountains are like no other, not only in geological structure but in their unique beauty. The Dolomites are simply out of this world, with distinctive jagged tooth-like peaks that glow pink at dawn and dusk - a phenomenon called ‘enrosadira’. They’re so special, the whole range is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. The entire area is a network of national parks, nature reserves, and endless walking opportunities with festivals, concerts, fairs and sporting events taking place throughout summer - there is plenty on offer for the whole family.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/a5aa350fc36c44c3a8c575345e8c7ceb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a5aa350fc36c44c3a8c575345e8c7ceb}" title="Selva" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Selva walking holidays</strong></a></p>
<h3>Walking in the Dolomites </h3>
<p>Buy a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.dolomitisuperski.com/en/SuperSummer/home" target="_blank">Dolomiti Supersummer</a> pass to use the lifts and ramble across hundreds of kilometres of mountain trails with endless walking opportunities, or get a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.valgardena.it/en/summer-holidays-dolomites/mobility/gardena-card/" target="_blank">Gardena card</a> if you want to stay local - this area has some of the best views, after all. Many beautiful <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.val-gardena.com/en/insider-tips/detail/the-most-beautiful-hikes-in-val-gardena-dolomites/" target="_blank">trails</a> start in Selva Gardena. One of the most popular is the Seceda Ridgeway, a 6-mile walk from the village centre to the top of the Seceda mountain, winding its way through lush meadows, dense forests and rocky terrain. All, of course, with unbeatable views. The Puez-Odle Nature Park, a protected area with some of the best Dolomite scenery, has a number of routes with varying difficulty, ranging from leisurely walks to strenuous hikes.</p>
<h3>Family adventures in Selva </h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.valgardena-active.com/en/experiences-summer/kids" target="_blank">Val Gardena Active programme</a> has lots of fun and free activities for kids and teens. With plenty of family-friendly hikes too! Set off together in search of adventure playgrounds or local wildlife. Teenagers will love the mountain lifestyle with plenty of things to do to get their adrenaline pumping, with zip-lining, hiking, mini-golf, and even mountain biking to try out. <span>See our 'things to do' tab for more information on family activities. </span></p>
<h3>E-biking in the Dolomites</h3>
<p>Tackle the hills and cruise along valley paths with the help of an electric motor, giving you the time to take in the mountain views. It doesn’t get much better than an e-bike tour of mountain huts, or ‘rifugi’ as they call them, to combine outdoor adventure with local food and wine.</p>
<h3>Selva culture and history</h3>
<p>Selva is steeped in culture and history. It has a rich Ladin heritage, with its unique customs, traditions and cuisine to discover. The region was also strategic during World War I with battles fought between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces along the mountain fronts. Cut into the mountains here are caves and tunnels, which are open for visitors to explore on walks. </p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Enjoy activities with the Val Gardena active programme</h3>
<p>Get involved with as many activities as you want with the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.valgardena-active.com/en/summer" target="_blank">Val Gardena active programme</a>. They include guided walks, Nordic walking tasters, food &amp; wine experiences, climbing, biking and lots more. Activities are either free or discounted when you stay at affiliated hotels.</p>
<p>Affiliated hotels include<strong>:</strong> Hotel Oswald, Hotel Rodella, Hotel Aaritz, Hotel Mignon, Hotel Somont, Hotel Stella</p>
<h3>Test out your climbing skills on a via ferrata</h3>
<p>Our favourite is the via ferrata Mesules. You'll need to be in good shape for this one but it's great if you want a challenge and you'll see almost the entire Sella Group on the descent.</p>
<h3>Thrilling mountain biking trails</h3>
<p>Mountain biking in the area is second to none. Head for the freeride trails or stick with the gentle winding routes on the family line - both are fun. Best of all the lifts take you to the top of the runs, so all you need to do is enjoy the ride down.</p>
<h3>Incredible local food</h3>
<p>The food won’t disappoint here. Typical mountain fare has more Austro-Hungarian influences than it does Italian but don't worry it’s easy to stumble upon fresh, stone-baked pizzas. Plan your hikes around the mountain huts where you can have lunch - there's more than 60 to choose from.</p>
<h3>Visit Val Gardena's villages</h3>
<p>Head along the road to the pretty villages of San Cristina and <a data-udi="umb://document/a7a8ad5233804c39b1e02e8dd02cc1fc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a7a8ad5233804c39b1e02e8dd02cc1fc}" title="Ortisei">Ortisei,</a> they're linked by the fascinating Val Gardena railway trail. Both villages are soaked in tradition with local markets, pretty churches and boutique shops. There's even craft breweries. Not to mention the spectacular mountain panoramas.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<p><strong>Recommended equipment</strong></p>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful - you can rent them in resort from around €8 per day.</p>
<p><strong>Walking maps</strong></p>
<p>Val Gardena Outdoor is available for free on <a rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outdooractive.groeden&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" data-anchor="?id=com.outdooractive.groeden&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a> or the <a rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/val-gardena-gr%C3%B6den-outdoor/id1185520171" target="_blank">App Store</a> and has quite a few walks on there to get you started. For paper maps, we recommend Kompass 59 or Kompass 76.</p>
<p><strong>Walking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Selva</h3>
<p>Selva is perfectly set up for walking and exploring the outdoors. There are some great opportunities to join guided walks and activities with the Val Gardena Active Programme, just book these at the tourist office the day before you want to go. Lots of our hotels are really outdoors focused and some offer their own guided walks. These are fantastic to go on as the hoteliers often take you out personally and show you what they love about the area. There are so many different landscapes to discover in the Val Gardena, from meadows and farms, to lakes and rocky mountain routes. It's also a great place for spotting local wildlife such as, horses, cows and even marmots!</p>
<h3>Inghams Guided Walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
