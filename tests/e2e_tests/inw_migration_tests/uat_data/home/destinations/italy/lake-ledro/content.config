  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Canoe or kayak along Lake Ledro's crystal clear waters</li>
<li>Walk along the Ponale Way to Riva in Lake Garda</li>
<li>Discover local history at the Pile Dwelling Museum</li>
</ul>
<p>Lake Ledro is a scene straight out of a fairy tale, with emerald waters that, in the summer, mirror the mountains and pine forests all around. Walking trails circle the lake and zig-zag down to <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a>– the northernmost town of <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>. There are around 200km worth of walking trails around these parts, so it’s a case of pick a path, any path. Just make sure to stop at the alpine cheese huts and panoramic viewpoints along the way.</p>
<h2>Exploring Ledro's looking-glass lake</h2>
<p>Relaxation is the theme in Lake Ledro. Walking along the easy-going 9km loop around the lake takes in the pebble beaches and picnic spots that dot the water’s edge. Paddlers can hire a paddle board or kayak and glide across the mirror-like water, which can reach a balmy 24˚C in summer– so no worries if you end up spending more time in the water than out. Windsurfing, sailing and pedalos are also popular pursuits on a summer holiday.</p>
<h2>Walking along fairytale pathways</h2>
<p>The old Ponale Road leads between Lake Ledro and Riva, on the northern shore of Lake Garda. This panoramic path shadows the lake line, meandering downhill through woodland trails, valleys and cobbled mule paths – all reserved for walkers and cyclists. If you head north-west, you’ll come to the cascading Gorg d’Abiss waterfall, where some seriously enchanting scenery is tucked away. The Ledro Land Art trail is on the south side of the lake, where you can go on a treasure-hunt looking for around twenty sculptures which are dotted amongst the trees.</p>
<h2>Unravelling 4,000 years’ of history at Molina di Ledro</h2>
<p>Palafitte stilt houses decorate the eastern end of Lake Ledro. Dating back to 2200-1350 BC, these pre-historic thatched dwellings were rediscovered in 1929, when the lake’s water levels were lowered to fuel the hydro-electric plant in Riva. The Museum of Pile Dwellings reveals the origins and the daily lives of the Bronze Age residents who once lived in these lovingly restored buildings.</p>
<h2>Food, glorious food: eating in Lake Ledro</h2>
<p>Alpine food and drink is the speciality of Lake Ledro, where family-run farms produce Trentino specialities with a whole lot of Italian love and several generations’ worth of knowledge. Try creamy alpine cheeses at a local dairy or pull up a chair on the terrace of a mountain hut for a feast of caponec (sausage, herbs and cheese packed into vine leaves) and strangolapreti (spinach and Parmesan dumplings). Fancy a celebratory holiday fizz? The Ledro summer favourite is a picco spritz of strawberry and raspberry liqueur from the Ledro Valley, prosecco and tonic water. Cin cin!</p>
<h2>Family holidays on the lake</h2>
<p>If your family's a fan of summer holidays abundant in water sports and lakeside entertainment then Lake Ledro's the perfect choice for you. The lake is relatively un-crowded making canoeing, sailing, kayaking, wind-surfing and paddle boarding all the more fun- there's plenty of space to paddle around without running into other lake-traffic. Swimming in the lake is very popular in the hotter months, due to its famously clean waters- children will have a great time splashing about in the water or playing on lakeside beaches on a summer's day.</p>

This day trip dips into the romance of the medieval city, reliving the scenes from Romeo and Juliet while wandering around through the cobbled streets and past ancient buildings. The impressive 2,000-year-old Roman arena is one of the best preserved Roman amphitheatres in the world and is currently home to the Verona Opera, and the marble paved shopping street of Via Mazzini leads you to the stunning Piazza Delle Erbe.

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Watersports on your summer holiday</h3>
<p>Ledro's a fantastic spot for watersports, which are great fun for families; the clear, fresh water is perfect for swimming, sailing, canoeing and windsurfing. The Trentino region is also popular for canyoning, which may appeal to active teenagers. Glide down rocky canyons and slide into refreshing rockpools- this fun activity is a great way for youngsters to meet some friends on their summer holiday. With the Trentino Guest card it's easy to hop on a bus over to Riva in Lake Garda which is another fantastic place to try out some water-based activities in a different setting.</p>
<h3>Family walking and biking in the Ledro Valley</h3>
<p>Another way to enjoy the area on your family holiday is by checking out one of the many walking and biking trails in the valley. There are at least 200km worth of trails around, so you'll have plenty of choice of child and teenager friendly walking trails to head out on. Why not go in search of Lake Ledro's popular land art project in the Pur forest, where you'll find around 20 works of wood and metal art by local artists dotted around a forest trail.</p>]]></festivals>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Discovering local history in Lake Ledro</h3>
<p>If you're a history lover, make sure you check out the UNESCO Pile Dwelling museum in Molina di Ledro. It's a reconstruction of a village from the Bronze Age which is a great way to learn about the daily life of people living around the lake between 2200-1350 BC, 4000 years ago. If you're on a family holiday, this is a great way to get children excited about history on their summer holiday. The Garibaldi Museum's also great to visit, particularly if you're interested in learning about Italy and the area during the Great War. Did you know Ledro was on the front line in World War 1?</p>
<h3>Exploring nearby lakes &amp; waterfalls</h3>
<p>If you love exploring nature, take a day trip to Lake Ampola on the bus, the journey will take you about an hour, otherwise hire a taxi and you can get there in about ten minutes. The lake has been kept in its completely natural state and the nature reserve's full of animals. In the summer there are endless types of insects, birds and mammals going about their daily lives. Our favourite thing about Ampola is the water lilies that bloom in the spring and turn the whole pond yellow. For a beautiful walk, make sure you head to the Gorg d'Abiss waterfall in Tiarno di Sotto, which is hidden away in the valley. You have to walk along a narrow path along the Massangla stream to get there, but it's worth it in the end!</p>
<h3>Tasting local food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love cheese? The cheese in the Lake Ledro area is fantastic. You can visit the Alpine dairy farms and see typical Italian cheese being made from scratch. The Ledro Valley's full of regional dishes, one of which, is Caponec, a sausage, herb and cheese mixture wrapped in vine leaves. There are also the hearty strangolapreti, green dumplings from Trentino, flavoured with spinach and parmesan. When it's time for a holiday aperitivo, the Picco spritz is definitely one to try on a sunny day. It's a cocktail made with Picco Rosso, a strawberry and raspberry liqueur from the Ledro Valley and garnished with strawberries- delicious!</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<p><strong>Walking maps &amp; apps</strong></p>
<p>The Trentino Outdoor app is useful if you’re looking to plan some of your own walking routes on holiday. It has information on walking routes, offline maps and GPS tracking. If you're looking for a paper map to purchase, the <span>Upper Garda, Ledro, Valle del Sarca Kompass hiking map 096 (1.25 000) covers the area.</span></p>
<p><strong>Walking guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The mountains and lakes are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help them stay that way, and remain enjoyable and safe places for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:</li>
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Ledro</h3>
<p>From flat lakeside promenades to steep mountain climbs, the walking area around Lake Ledro has something for everyone. You can explore trails along the shores of Lake Garda, venture into the mountains, or walk through lush valleys and charming villages. Our favourite trail, The Ponale Way, links Lake Ledro to <a data-udi="umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8bac09b5ee37405a9498e1494235fa01}" title="Riva">Riva</a> in <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, it takes you along cliff paths, with lake views and through the occasional tunnel built into the cliffside. It’s one of the most popular routes in the area and means you can head to Lake Garda for the day and get to know a new part of the Trentino region.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
