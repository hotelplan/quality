  <description><![CDATA[<p>With <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" target="_blank" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> to the east and <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/7d421e04a79044babf8cafda30e31d4a" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7d421e04a79044babf8cafda30e31d4a}" target="_blank" title="Lake Como">Lake Como</a> to the west, Lake Iseo is a case of out of sight, out of mind for many visitors to the Italian Lakes. Italians, meanwhile, have been spending their summer holidays here for decades, drawn in by the laid-back fishing towns strung around the waterfront – and the walking, cycling and ferry routes that link them. Iseo town, on the south bank, comes alive in the summer. From here, ferries cross between fishing villages and sanctuary-topped islands. Up in the hills, wine-makers are busy creating Lake Iseo’s beloved Franciacorta fizz, as they have done for generations.</p>
<h3>Introducing Iseo: food, wine, history and nature</h3>
<p>The lake’s namesake town, Iseo, makes a great base for a walking and foodie holiday. Arcaded cafés and shops surround the main square, Piazza Garibaldi, where an historic market filled with everything from creamy farmhouse cheeses to silver jewellery, pops up every Friday. From the piazza, medieval streets curve past trattorias, with their red-checked tablecloths and seafood menus, to the palm-lined promenade – the starting point for a leisurely lakeside 'passeggiata'.</p>
<h3>Walking trails: pull up a (really, really) Big Bench</h3>
<p>Walks in Lake Iseo range from sedate strolls along the promenade to mountain climbs – but they all encourage wanderers to pause and take in the views. The Big Benches art project has placed BFG-sized seats at strategic viewpoints to rest weary legs upon… if you can clamber onto them.</p>
<p>For a different type of scramble, ascend the rocky path to San Defendente, a church with an uninterrupted view of Corna Trentapassi peak. Easy routes through the Piramidi di Zone Nature Reserve showcase more in the way of geological wonders, with well-marked paths snaking past stalagmite-like rock formations. Or, you can head to the southern edge of Iseo, where wooden walkways criss-cross the swaying reed-beds of the Torbiere del Sebino Nature Reserve.</p>
<h3>Summer in Franciacorta: Italy’s champagne region</h3>
<p>Over 100 family-run vineyards stripe the hills of Lake Iseo, all on a mission to produce the finest glass of Franciacorta sparkling wine. This wine is as close to champagne as an Italian sparkling gets – but (we’ll go there) it’s even tastier. A bit like Lake Iseo, Franciacorta is popular in Italy but isn’t sipped as much abroad. Tours of labyrinth cellars and lake-view vineyards reveal each winery’s secrets, whether that’s their passion for organic vines or the story behind Italy’s first sparkling rosé. We musn’t forget that, of course, all tours end in a wine tasting! We'd recommend booking one of these tours in advance with the vineyard as they book up quickly. The vineyards are not on the doorstep of our destinations, but they're accessible by taxi (payable locally) if you're looking to do a day trip - we'd suggest being very organised in order to get the true Franciacorta wine experience and planning the day well in advance.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing fun: ferry routes to Sarnico, Monte Isola &amp; more</h3>
<p>Passenger ferries putter between towns like Iseo, Sarnico, Castro and Pisogne, taking just over two hours to cross the whole lake from north to south. If you have time for only one trip, go for the crossing to car-free Monte Isola island. Fishing traditions are still going strong here. Silvery fish dry on lines along the shore and net-making is a living tradition – including making nets for football goals used in the FIFA World Cup. For the best views in the summer, follow the stone mule tracks up to Madonna della Ceriola – a frescoed church perched on the highest point of the island.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Getting around Lake Iseo without a car, you must be happy taking various forms of public transport. If you're looking to expand your walking portfolio on the lake, then there are so many beautiful routes that can be accessed using the public transport links in the area.</p>
<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The ferries are a great way to get around Lake Iseo in the summer, you can check the timetables and prices on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/en/" target="_blank">Navigazione Lago Iseo</a> website, this is also where you'll find the list of <a rel="noopener" href="https://navigazionelagoiseo.it/en/scheduled-services/" target="_blank">ferry stopping points</a> from Iseo town. If you're visiting Monte Isola for the day, take the ferry from Sarnico; it's an easy and scenic way to get around. Ferry timetables will be amended and may be running on a reduced service from 1st September in line with late-season demand.</p>
<h3>Trains &amp; Buses</h3>
<p>Lake Iseo has trains and buses linking to most of the main towns around Lake Iseo. These are useful if you want to hop over to a nearby town relatively cheaply. All of our hotels are within walking distance or have nearby bus links to Iseo train station.</p>
<p>Why not hop on a train to the village of Sulzano (approx. 7 mins) where you can hop on a ferry to the famous Monte Isola! If you want to go slightly further to the North of the lake, take the train to the town of Pisogne (approx. 30 mins), first documented in the 13th Century. This ancient town is home to the hidden gem, Church of Santa Maria della Neve; it's walls are covered in frescoes by Romanino! Or, head over to Sarnico on the bus (approx. 15 mins) and admire the 15th Century Church of San Paolo or gaze at some fantastic art in the Gianni Bellini Picture Gallery.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Lake Iseo happily lives in the shadow of its famous neighbours, quietly producing some of the best wine – and best views – in the Italian lakes]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p>Check out the Medieval Iseo Town, explore the back streets and open-air squares and a lakefront lined with stylish cafes and bars. Iseo's main attraction is the Monte Isola, the largest land island in Europe. Monte Isola's completely pedestrianised and easily reached by boat from Iseo and Sulzano. It's a fantastic spot for a walk. Cruise the lake on the ferries or catch the train to see the other main towns: Sulzano and Pisogne. Bergamo's also close-by. Take a day trip and get to know this historic city which dates back to the 6th Century BC.</p>
<p>If you love getting outdoors and being active, Iseo's a great place for walking, whether you're hiking or taking gentle lakeside strolls. The Lake Iseo railway from Brescia's a great way to explore the lake and its surrounding areas. If you're looking for gentle walks you can check out the nearby Torbiere del Sebino. It's a wetland nature reserve, and is always a highlight for birdwatchers and wildlife enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>
<p>If you love sardines, then Iseo's your dream place- one of their most traditional foods is dried sardines, usually eaten with Polenta. If sardines aren't your favourite then try the Casoncelli, stuffed pasta (like ravioli) or salami from Monte Isola. Cheese is always important in the Italian lake district and Lake Iseo's no exception. Silter DOP is a hard cheese from the lower Camonica Valley made from the milk of the brown cows of Monte Guglielmo. Perfect with your Franciacorta wine and salami.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>If you fancy a day trip, head to the Church of Santa Maria delle Neve in Pisogne, where you'll find frescoes of the Passion of the Christ by Romanino. For more art don't miss the Valcamonica rock engravings in Capo di Ponte, which have been engraved over thousands of years, from the pre-historic to medieval and iron ages. This is fantastic if you want a more personal look at the area throughout the ages.</p>
<p>There are plenty of castles for you to enjoy, like the 12th Century Breno Castle and the Castello Quistini. The Castello Quistini has stunning gardens which you can also visit. Find a secluded spot and think about all the amazing things you've seen so far.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p><span>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</span></p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Iseo</h3>
<p>From 'Giant Bench' instalments to the natural phenomenon of the pyramids of Zone, there are so many hidden gems to discover when walking around Lake Iseo and walking for all abilities is on offer. If you want a more challenging but rewarding walk then go in search of the pyramids which are 30 metre high vertical slabs of rock, surrounded by boulders, in the middle of a nature reserve. On the other hand, if you're wanting something more relaxed there are plenty of flatter lakeside walks, and even more opportunities for tasting the local Franciacorta wine!</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>
<h3>Tourist office</h3>
<p>The tourist office can also provide more information locally on walks in the area, in addition to our guided walks. </p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
