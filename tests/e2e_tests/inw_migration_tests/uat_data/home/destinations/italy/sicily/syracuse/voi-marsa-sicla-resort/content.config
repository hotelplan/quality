  <description><![CDATA[<p>The VOI Marsa Siclà Resort has plenty to offer guests of all ages and is a great choice for families. Built in the attractive style of typical Sicilian farmhouses, it is surrounded by established greenery and a large swimming pool. A lovely sandy beach is just over one kilometer from the resort, and can be reached by a pleasant walk or by the hotel's complimentary shuttle. Once you arrive, you'll find plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas placed on the white sands, shallow waters that are ideal for younger guests and plenty of watersports to try. </p>
<p>A choice of board options are available at this expansive hotel, from bed and breakfast to ultra all inclusive. <em>Il Baglio Restaurant</em> is the main restaurant of the hotel and its menus are designed around families with a mixture of Sicilian and international cuisine offered as part of the rich buffet. We recommend trying the fresh pizza that's made using locally-sourced ingredients in a traditional wood-fired oven - it's perfect washed down with an artisinal Sicilian beer.</p>
<p>Guest rooms are located in cottages scattered throughout the grounds and have been decorated in a Mediterranean style with whites and fresh blue colours. Within the resort there is a children's play area and a Mini Club for ages 6-12 years with an array of games and sports to keep them entertained during the day. A large swimming pool sits proudly in the centre and expands over 1,000 square metres with two swimming lanes. There is also solarium that has umbrellas, deckchairs sunbeds and tables to make your stay even more enjoyable and relaxing.</p>]]></description>
