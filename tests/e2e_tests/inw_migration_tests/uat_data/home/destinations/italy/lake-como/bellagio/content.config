  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Enjoy a sunset aperitivo in a lakeside bar</li>
<li>Walk through a network of historic cobbled streets</li>
<li>Take the ferry to explore other towns on the lake; from Varenna to Menaggio</li>
</ul>
<p>With its spot on a panoramic peninsula hugged by the two arms of Lake Como, Bellagio is one of the prettiest towns on the lake– and everyone knows it. Celtics, Romans, Greeks, Lombards and Saxons have all wrestled over its enviable position. Even Virgil waxed lyrical about Bellagio back in the day, along with a host of Romantic artists who made the villas and gardens here their summer retreats. Summer walking holidays in Bellagio follow in the footsteps of the Romantics, taking the time to soak up sublime views, stories and scenic paths both in town and the surrounding villages.</p>
<h2>Exploring Bellagio in the summer: from popular palazzos to Borgo’s backstreets</h2>
<p>Bellagio sits on the Lario peninsula, balancing churches, eateries, shops and winding cobbled streets between the water’s edge and the hills behind. Boats arrive at Piazza Mazzini, spilling summertime day-trippers into the waterfront square and streets. When it gets busy, dive into the old town of Borgo, following the backstreets to San Giacomo’s petite piazza. The ornate Italian parks and gardens are also a breath of fresh air. We love walking around Villa Melzi which lays out avenues of trees and rhododendron displays in its waterfront gardens, while Villa Serbelloni’s park– owned by the Rockefeller Foundation– paints a swathe of the peninsula with forested paths.</p>
<h2>Walking at great heights and views over Lake Como</h2>
<p>Even a stroll in Bellagio usually involves some climbing, with staircases which lead past houses adorned with balconies overflowing with flowers and ivy. Plenty of nature trails wind their way through the Lario Peninsula, threading together pine forests, meadows and farmhouses; perfect for walking through on your summer holiday. If you fancy a bike ride with a spectacular lake view, pedal up (and up) to the historic sanctuary and museum dedicated to Madonna del Ghisallo, the patron saint of cyclists… who, of course, are blessed with free entry.  </p>
<h2>Food &amp; drink in Bellagio: dining off the beaten track</h2>
<p>It’s very tempting to follow the crowds to the waterfront restaurants in Bellagio. However, the best Italian food and drink is found in the backstreets, where tiny cantinas and courtyard enotecas serve traditional dishes and excellent house wines. It’s rare to see tóc on the menu these days, but if you do then grab the chance to try this Bellagio special of cheesy polenta– usually shared between families on feast days. Salami, stuffed chicken and lake fish (salted missoltino is the Lake Como favourite) more commonly pop up on menus.</p>
<h2>Exploring Lake Como: Varenna and other lakeside villages</h2>
<p>With the long and winding roads of Lake Como, it’s best to ditch the car and stick to ferries– both an easy and enjoyable way to travel in the summer, thanks to Bellagio’s seat in the middle of Lake Como. Visit Varenna, on the eastern shore, to admire the fishing village’s sunset-hued houses and waterside restaurants, gelato shops and market stalls. A walk up to Castello di Vezio offers views across the lake. Alternatively, take the ferry to Como Town, Tremezzo or <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a>, or putter all the way north to the age-old village of Domaso.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The ferry network is one of the most efficient ways to explore the lake. With direct links between <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a> and Bellagio and access to many other resorts, we'd recommend making the most of it on your summer holiday. Buy a 6 day ferry pass for easy access to resorts in the central Lake Como area. For more information head to the Cards &amp; Passes tab. The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/tickets-and-timetables-lake-como/" target="_blank">official ferry website</a> has information about timetables and dropping off points.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>The buses in our resorts can be a useful and cost effective way of travelling short distances along the lakeside. For getting to next door towns and attractions such as Villa Balbianello in <a data-udi="umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7}" title="Lenno">Lenno</a>. The C10 bus will take you directly from Menaggio to Lenno in under 20 minutes. However, if you're hoping for a punctual service, the ferry is the better option as the buses run on their own timetable and may not come when you expect them to!</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>The Greenway Path</h3>
<p>The Greenway Path is one of the most popular trails in Lake Como. Its well-maintained paths and gentle ascent makes it accessible for all walking abilities. The walk takes you through some of the most charming villages on the lake, including: Colonno, Sala Comacina, Ossuccio, Lenno, Mezzegra, Tremezzo and Cadenabbia before arriving at the village of Griante. The path follows some of the old ‘Antica Strada Regina’ and takes you up to some beautiful viewpoints of the lake and through some traditional towns on the mountain side, slightly off the usual tourist trail.</p>
<ul>

<h3>San Martino Chapel Walk</h3>
<p>The church of San Martino sits at an altitude of 475m on the steep slopes of Sasso San Martino above the village of Griante. An easy path leads up to the church from where you have one of the most beautiful views of the central part of Lake Como. The walk is mostly an ascent up the mountain, but the trails are well-maintained and easy to navigate. You'll pass through wooded areas and come across little religious shrines, dotted along the path. Make sure you read up about the history of the church before you go, in particular its relation to the First World War.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[An impossibly picturesque lakeside town with hideaway wine bars and hilly walking– it’s easy to see why Bellagio is called the Pearl of Lake Como]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Discovering cathedrals and churches</h3>
<p>Lake Como's religious past means you'll find cathedrals, churches, chapels and baptistery's dotted everywhere you go. Many of which are dedicated to different saint's and religious figures. From the more niche 17th Century Sanctuary of Madonna del Ghisallo, the patron saint of cyclists, to the more familiar 12-13th Century Romanesque Basilica of San Giacomo, patron saint of pilgrims and soldiers. We'd always recommend popping into an Italian religious building when you get the chance, as more often or not, you'll find a few hidden artistic gems, sometimes by master painters; and if nothing else the architecture is always something to be marveled at.</p>
<h3>Attractions in Bellagio: walking through botanical gardens</h3>
<p>Whilst in Bellagio, make sure you head over to the 19th Century neo-classical Villa Melzi, famous for its beautifully curated botanical gardens. The villa was built as the summer house of Francesco Melzi d’Eril, who was vice president of the Italian Republic during Napoleon's rule. Stroll through labyrinths of azaleas and rhododendrons and breathe in the floral aromas, discover Napoleonic history in the museum and soak up the atmosphere in the little family chapel. Finish the day with a cup of tea or a glass of prosecco in a lakeside cafè.</p>
<h3>Exploring other towns on Lake Como</h3>
<p>With its central ferry point and regular services, Bellagio's a fantastic base if you're hoping to explore several towns on your summer holiday. Head over to <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a> for the day and walk along the lakeside promenade, grabbing a gelato on your way. From this side of the lake you can easily access the famous Greenway Path or walk up to the Church of San Martino; we highly recommend this walk, not only for the incredible lake views, but for its historical significance, which is worth reading up on.</p>
<p>If you head over to Cadenabbia and Tremezzo, then don't miss the Villa Carlotta and its botanical gardens. Built by the Marquis of Milan at the end of the 17th Century and well worth a visit if you're in the area. Como city is also around 45 minutes away on the ferry, which is home to the awe-inspiring Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, built in the Gothic style. The cathedral we see today was completed in the 18th Century and has an intricate Rococo cupola and 15th Century Rose Window, which is a real treat for art history lovers.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Como</h3>
<p>Want to get to know the real Lake Como? Then put on your walking boots and hit the trails above the lake. Walking above and around the lake will open up an entire area of traditional farmland, mountain huts, sleepy old towns and historic churches, that you'd have never seen following the typical tourist trail. There's so much more to Lake Como than just celebrity-spotting or snapping lakeside Instagram photos, and walking is the way to discover the area in a whole new light.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
