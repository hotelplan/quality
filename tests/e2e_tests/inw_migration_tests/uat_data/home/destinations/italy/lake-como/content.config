  <description><![CDATA[<h3>Discovering Lake Como</h3>
<p>Lake Como cuts a dashing figure on the map. Its wishbone-shaped waters make up the deepest lake in Italy, stretching out one arm north to the Alps and two arms south towards Milan. Fine villas, vineyards and gardens decorate mountainous shores that have been the backdrop to many a Hollywood film, from James Bond to Star Wars– places best explored by walking along the footpaths that connect them. Boats shuttle wanderers between <a data-udi="umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7}" title="Lenno">Lenno</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a>, and <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a><a data-udi="umb://document/8b37cb2bfc354628b321751c199d4032" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8b37cb2bfc354628b321751c199d4032}" title="Cadenabbia"></a>, each of which have their own footpaths, stories and cuisine to share. Thanks to its spot on the border, day trips to <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d}" target="_blank" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> are easy!</p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Lake Como</h3>
<p>Lake Como lies in spectacular surroundings best explored by its footpaths. In the summer, the 10km-long Greenway path is a highlight, rolling easily between Colonno and Tremezzo via a labyrinth of lakeside villages, gothic churches, Roman roads and villas with cypress-brushed gardens. Alternatively, set your sights on rocky mountain peaks such as Monte Grona, which reward walkers with widescreen views over Lake Como.</p>
<p>Of course, every rambler needs refuelling– perhaps with a plate of grilled perch and risotto, a glass of the local Valtellina red, or simply a cappuccino while watching the world go by.</p>
<h3>Things to do in Lake Como</h3>
<p>Lakeside paths connect many of the towns of Lake Como– or you can hop aboard the boats that travel between. Take note of the calendar too. There’s a market on practically every day of the week in Lake Como. Depending on the day, you could wind up browsing market stalls along the old town walls of Como, picking up alpine cheese, honey and jam in Bellano, or perusing intricate lace souvenirs in Cernobbio.</p>
<p>Lake Como has long been a glamorous holiday spot. Wealthy Romans built some of the first villas on the lakeshore; these days, you’re more likely to bump into Hollywood A-listers such as George Clooney. The real stars of the show, however, are the villas themselves. Star Wars and James Bond fans may recognise Lenno’s Villa del Balbianello, with its romantic gardens and fairy-tale towers. Then there are the sculpture galleries of 17th century Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo and the waterside gardens of Bellagio’s Villa Melzi– one of the prettiest walks in Lake Como.</p>
<h3>Activities in Lake Como</h3>
<p>The unusual geography of Lake Como creates summer breezes ideal for sailing, kitesurfing, wakeboarding and windsurfing in the north, and kayaking and paddle-boarding in the more sheltered corners of the south. This is one of the deepest lakes in Europe; where locals have come up with nicknames for at least six types of wind, so exploring with a local guide who knows how to safely navigate the waters is always recommended.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer months festivities liven up the lakeshore. The City of Music Festival in Como transforms the town into one giant music, dance and art venue with shows and performances taking place at various historic locations. In July and August the Bellagio Festival brings concerts, films and performances to many of the lakeside towns. They’re held in gorgeous settings like churches, piazzas and castles.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink in Lake Como</h3>
<p>On Lake Como you won’t struggle to find delicious food and drink. Freshwater fish from the lake and rice from the nearby flatlands are essential ingredients in many of the local specialties. Risotto with perch fillets (Risotto con filetti di pesce persico) is Lake Como’s regional dish and typical of Italy's Lombardy region. For dessert give Torta Miascia a try– it’s a traditional cake containing amaretti, fruit (apples, pears, raisins), chocolate and all sorts of delicious things.</p>
<p>We can’t forget to mention the wine. Vineyards to the south in Brianza and on the northern end of the lake above Domaso produce some lovely local wines. It’s great to visit in autumn when the grape harvest is in full swing. The Valtellina is another area of vineyards where they produce Valtellina Superiore DOCG red wine. Our favourite post-dinner night cap is Braulio a strong spiced liquor which is typical of the region- we love relaxing in the bar at the end of the day, with a small glass of this over ice.</p>

  <inAround><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Lake Como</h2>
<p>There are lots of places to see and things to do on your summer holiday in Lake Como. Explore stunning lakeside towns from <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> to <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a>, using the regular ferry service that links them. It’s a beautiful way to see the lake from a different perspective and the views from the water are fantastic.</p>
<h3>Follow in the footsteps of stars: from George Clooney to James Bond</h3>
<p>Explore some of Lake Como's most spectacular villas and gardens, including the 17th century Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo which houses sculptures by Canova. Why not head to Bellagio to scope out the stunning Villa Melzi and walk around its vibrant botanical gardens and museum, or book dinner at the acclaimed Villa Serbeloni, where you can enjoy a fantastic local culinary experience. If you head over to Laglio, see if you can get a glimpse of George Clooney's old Lake Como stamping ground, Villa Oleandra, located directly on the lakeside.</p>
<p>Many film buffs will also recognise the Villa Balbianello in <a data-udi="umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7}" title="Lenno">Lenno</a>– it featured in two of the biggest blockbusters of the modern age, including James Bond: Casino Royale and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The villa offers discounted entry to National Trust members, so don’t forget your card!</p>
<h3>Discovering the real Lake Como: walking on your summer holiday</h3>
<p>Lake Como is a great choice for a summer holiday. Spend your holiday marvelling at Lake Como from above. Walk along the famous Greenway Path and through sleepy villages which will give you a taste of the old Lake Como (before it became 'Lake Como'). Or, walk up to the historic Church of San Martino, and learn about its fascinating World War I history. You can also head up Monte Grona, the rocky peak above Menaggio. There are lots of lovely walking routes in the area and Via Ferrata for the more adventurous holiday-makers.</p>
<p>In the summer, many hill, mountain and lakeside walks are just a bus ride away, with miles of old mule tracks and well-marked footpaths, it's a back-packers paradise! History buffs might be interested in the walk from Colonno to Cadenabbia. It passes the village of Mezzegra where Benito Mussolini was killed as he tried to flee to Switzerland with his lover Claretta Petacci.</p>
<h3>Summer fun: activities in and around the lake</h3>
<p>We’d definitely recommend exploring Lake Como from the water. There are loads of activities for you to try like kayaking, water skiing, swimming and sailing. There’s also a regular ferry service and all sorts of boats available to hire. The geography of the lake means it has the ideal wind conditions for wind-surfing, so it's a great place to go if that's your cup of tea.</p>
<p>If you want to venture further afield- Milan is easily reachable on a day trip. Hop on a direct train from your nearest Lake Como station or book onto our Milan excursion. Spend the day admiring Milan Cathedral, perusing the shops in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele and sipping an espresso, Italian style, in the Piazza del Duomo.</p>]]></inAround>
