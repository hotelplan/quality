  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Immerse yourself in the world of James Bond at the iconic Villa Balbianello</li>
<li>Take a relaxing walk along Lenno's lakeside promenade</li>
<li>Enjoy a leisurely lunch and creamy gelato by the lake</li>
</ul>
<p>Lenno, on the western shore of Lake Como, marks the start of the richly decorated hamlets of the Costa della Tremezzina. A promenade, waterside restaurants and a fringe of groves and vineyards first planted by the Romans all curve around the horseshoe bay. Don’t worry if you get a strange sense of déjà vu whilst walking around the Villa Balbianello on your summer holiday. Lenno has doubled as a film set since Hitchcock shot his debut film here in the 1920s. The region’s real stories, however, are even more interesting, with a Celtic, Greco-Roman and rebellious partisan World War history lying behind the Hollywood polish.</p>
<h2>Relaxing on your summer holiday: getting to know Lenno</h2>
<p>Lenno might be small, but its summer-time offering of things to do is mighty. This little town is filled with cosy trattorias, grand villas, a lido, Romanesque churches– as well as cobbled streets to walk through. However, one of the best things to do is absolutely nothing. Pull up a chair in a waterfront restaurant, order a cappuccino and drink in the views across the water to <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> and the mountains. Ferries putter from the pier, headed for the other towns of Lake Como.</p>
<h2>Exploring historic houses: Villa Balbianello</h2>
<p>Most people visiting Lenno in the summer make a beeline for Villa Balbianello. Perched on the Lavedo promontory, it offers 360-degree views of the lake– exactly what made it an irresistible backdrop for Hollywood productions such as Star Wars and James Bond: Casino Royale. We love strolling through the waterside gardens of holm oaks and statue-topped terraces; it gives you those classic Italian summer holiday vibes.</p>
<p>Walking tours delve into the house museum, which is largely dedicated to the Italian mountaineer and explorer Guido Monzino, who lived here until his death in 1984. As well as an extensive library of maps, the exhibition includes a dog sled from an expedition to the North Pole.</p>
<h2>Walking through Lake Como</h2>
<p>Feeling inspired by Guido’s explorations? Head out onto the trails of Lake Como for a mini adventure. The Lake Como Greenway passes through town on its way to Campo, a medieval hamlet with a maze of shoulder-width alleys and stone houses. Alternatively, head north through neighbouring Azzano, where local partisans resisted the fascist regime of Mussolini– and where he was assassinated in 1945. Continue to Tremezzo, meandering past churches, palaces and tiny museums dedicated to nativity scenes. The historic 12<sup>th</sup>-century Acquafredda Abbey also lies on the northern edge of town; approach via a photogenic path through olive trees.</p>
<h2>Food &amp; Drink: lunches on Lenno lakeside</h2>
<p>Lake-view restaurants range from smart restaurants to casual pizzerias. Seafood risotto and the almond-sprinkled torta Tremezzina are Lenno classics– and it’s well worth joining the queue at a popular gelateria for a scoop of lemon or raspberry gelato. In the summer, a market fills the waterfront Piazza XI Febbraio every Tuesday, with local traders selling everything from haberdashery and tools to mountain cheeses and bottles of the beloved local olive oil, which is still made in the old mill of Oleificio Vanini Osvaldo.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Lenno with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Lenno's best activities at your own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Lenno include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</span></p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The ferry network is one of the most efficient ways to explore the lake. With direct links between <a data-udi="umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/80beb49bbb7f416ba46131e7c79367b5}" title="Menaggio">Menaggio</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> and access to many other resorts, we'd recommend making the most of it on your summer holiday. Buy a 6 day ferry pass for easy access to resorts in the central Lake Como area. For more information head to the Cards &amp; Passes tab. The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/tickets-and-timetables-lake-como/" target="_blank">official ferry website</a> has information about timetables and dropping off points.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>The buses in our resorts can be a useful and cost effective way of travelling short distances along the lakeside. For getting to next door towns and attractions such as Villa Balbianello in Lenno. The C10 bus will take you directly from Menaggio to Lenno in under 20 minutes. However, if you're hoping for a punctual service, the ferry is the better option as the buses run on their own timetable and may not come when you expect them to!</p>]]></gettingAround>

<p>The Greenway Path is one of the most popular trails in Lake Como. Its well-maintained paths and gentle ascent makes it accessible for all walking abilities. The walk takes you through some of the most charming villages on the lake, including: Colonno, Sala Comacina, Ossuccio, Lenno, Mezzegra, Tremezzo and Cadenabbia before arriving at the village of Griante. The path follows some of the old ‘Antica Strada Regina’ and takes you up to some beautiful viewpoints of the lake and through some traditional towns on the mountain side, slightly off the usual tourist trail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent:</strong> 100m</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10km</li>
</ul>
<h3>San Martino Chapel Walk</h3>
<p>The church of San Martino sits at an altitude of 475m on the steep slopes of Sasso San Martino above the village of Griante. An easy path leads up to the church from where you have one of the most beautiful views of the central part of Lake Como. The walk is mostly an ascent up the mountain, but the trails are well-maintained and easy to navigate. You'll pass through wooded areas and come across little religious shrines, dotted along the path. Make sure you read up about the history of the church before you go, in particular its relation to the First World War.</p>

<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 3 hrs</li>

</ul>
<h3>Rifugio Menaggio</h3>
<p>Rifugio Menaggio (1400 m) is situated on the southern slope of Monte Grona where one can enjoy a spectacular view of Lake Como and the surrounding mountains. From the rifugio you can add on more by hiking to Monte Grona (1736 m) and to Monte Bregagno (2107 m). Or, stop for a drink and a bite to eat in the rifugio, before heading back to the walk starting point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bellagio–Brogno–Belvedere di Makallé–Visgnola–Bellagio</h3>
<p>A circular route heading past churches and through rustic villages and forested trails, this walk will take you over to Mount Nuvolone. Literally translated, Mount Nuvolone means Cloud Mountain; so you can imagine how good the views will be from up here! You'll head up to the Belvedere di Makallé which is a fantastic viewpoint with panoramas over the tip of Bellagio.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Lenno has star quality; providing a classic summertime cinematic setting of Italian lakeside villas, vineyards and olive groves to a wealth of Hollywood films]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Exploring famous villas: taking the star-studded route</h3>
<p>Villa Balbianello's the jewel in the crown of Lenno, with famous accolades from being a filming location for James Bond: Casino Royale and Star Wars. Its lush gardens are lovely to walk around, admiring the marble white sculptures and caryatids that give it it's characteristic elegance. If you're a National Trust member, don't forget to bring your card, as you'll get a discount on entry to the house and gardens. Combine your visit with a leisurely stroll down the promenade and a long lunch with a cold glass of wine in one of Lenno's lakeside cafés.</p>
<h3>Walking in Lenno: discovering the Greenway Path and more</h3>
<p>From Lenno or the nearby town of Tremezzo, you can easily get onto the famous Greenway Path, a well-maintained and sign-posted walking route which takes you above the lake and further up into the higher towns, land and villages above Como. Another fantastic walk heads up (and up) to the Church of San Martino; we highly recommend this walk, not only for the incredible lake views, but for its historical significance, which is worth reading up on.</p>
<p>These walks are a fantastic way to explore what towns on the lake would've looked like before they became popular tourist attractions. They'll give you an idea of the original Lake Como, when it was inhabited by local farmers and their families; peaceful, rustic and understated. Both walks lead up to some fantastic panoramic views of the lake and mountains, particularly in the sunshine- it's definitely a must-do on your summer holiday.</p>
<h3>Visiting nearby towns: from Bellagio to Como City</h3>
<p>Starting in Lenno, the towns of Varenna and <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> (The Pearl of Lake Como) are just a short ferry ride away, and perfect for a day trip. These are two of the prettiest towns on Lake Como, adorned with flower lined promenades, historic churches and several lakeside bars and cafès where you can stop for a spot of lunch. Varenna is also home to the Villa Monastero a 12th Century villa turned museum with stunning botanical gardens to explore.</p>
<p>If you head over to Cadenabbia and Tremezzo, then don't miss the Villa Carlotta and its botanical gardens. Built by the Marquis of Milan at the end of the 17th Century and well worth a visit if you're in the area. Como city is only around half an hour away on the ferry, which is home to the awe-inspiring Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, built in the Gothic style. The cathedral we see today was completed in the 18th Century and has an intricate Rococo cupola and 15th Century Rose Window, which is a real treat for art history lovers.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Como</h3>
<p>Want to get to know the real Lake Como? Then put on your walking boots and hit the trails above the lake. Walking above and around the lake will open up an entire area of traditional farmland, mountain huts, sleepy old towns and historic churches, that you'd have never seen following the typical tourist trail. There's so much more to Lake Como than just celebrity-spotting or snapping lakeside Instagram photos, and walking is the way to discover the area in a whole new light.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
