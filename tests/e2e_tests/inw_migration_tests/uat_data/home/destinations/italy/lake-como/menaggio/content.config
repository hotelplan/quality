  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk up to the Santuario di San Martino and learn about its rich history</li>
<li>Indulge in a gelato in Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi</li>
<li>Hop on a ferry to nearby towns like Bellagio</li>
</ul>
<p>Menaggio relaxes on the western shore of Lake Como, at the mouth of the valley to Lake Lugano. It’s a popular spot for the Milan elite who favour the extravagant piazzas and villas for their summer holidays. But for all its riches, Menaggio remains a welcoming town where a wealth of lake and mountain views (and tempting gelato shops) glitter around every corner. Walking and cycling paths reach around the lakefront and into the mountains behind– and it’s all just a 15-minute ferry ride from <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a>.</p>
<h2>Menaggio town: walking through the history books</h2>
<p>Civilisations have wrestled over Menaggio’s strategic, sheltered seat for thousands of years. Walking around town reveals remnants of Roman, Spanish and World War II fortifications. Alleys and stone staircases framed by shops, aperitivo bars and restaurants climb to the medieval part of town and the old castle. Here, you’ll also find the stone Church of San Carlo and its distinctly Spanish bell tower. Back at lake level, meander along Menaggio’s tree-lined waterfront– home to a pocket-sized harbour, palatial villas and a monument to the tessitrice silk weavers who once worked in the waterfront mills.</p>
<h2>Discovering mountain rifugi &amp; railway routes</h2>
<p>Want to do more than marvel at the mountains around you? Spends your summer holiday taking to the walking trails on Monte Grona, aiming for the rifugio restaurant and alpine dairy farms. The adventurous (and fit) can continue clambering to the peak, which offers dizzying views over three lakes. Easier walking and cycling routes include the route to Porlezza that traces the old railway line between Lake Como and Lake Lugano. Alternatively, head north to Sorico via the lakeside promenade and abandoned state road that runs through fishing villages and some seriously lovely mountain scenery.</p>
<h2>Exploring the crossroads of Lake Como</h2>
<p>Menaggio is the place where vital trade and transport routes once met, including the Via Regina, which connected Lake Como and Milan to the Alps beyond. These days, you can follow its steep tracks past sanctuaries, villages and stone bridges. Menaggio’s excellent connections extend to its boat routes too. Ferries scoot between the towns on Lake Como’s shores– Bellagio, Varenna, Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, Como Town– or you can explore the lake under your own steam aboard a sailing boat or kayak. A stunning way to spend your Italian summer holiday!</p>
<h2>Summer in Menaggio: life on the lake</h2>
<p>The squares and waterfront of Menaggio come alive in the summer, staging Renaissance concerts, craft markets, book fairs and open-air art exhibitions, as well as a Friday evening market. August’s International Guitar Festival treats visitors to impromptu “musical aperitivi” in the streets, whetting the appetite for the evening performances. Piazza Garibaldi is a great place walking around and soaking up the atmosphere, or sitting in a cafè with a cappuccino and plate of polenta in reach.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Menaggio with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Menaggio's best activities at your own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Menaggio include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</span></p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The ferry network is one of the most efficient ways to explore the lake. With direct links between Menaggio and <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> and access to many other resorts, we'd recommend making the most of it on your summer holiday. Buy a 6 day ferry pass for easy access to resorts in the central Lake Como area. For more information head to the Cards &amp; Passes tab. The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.navigazionelaghi.it/en/tickets-and-timetables-lake-como/" target="_blank">official ferry website </a>has information about timetables and dropping off points.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>The buses in our resorts can be a useful and cost effective way of travelling short distances along the lakeside. For getting to next door towns and attractions such as Villa Balbianello in <a data-udi="umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7}" title="Lenno">Lenno</a>. The C10 bus will take you directly from Menaggio to Lenno in under 20 minutes. However, if you're hoping for a punctual service, the ferry is the better option as the buses run on their own timetable and may not come when you expect them to!</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>The Greenway Path</h3>
<p>The Greenway Path is one of the most popular trails in Lake Como. Its well-maintained paths and gentle ascent makes it accessible for all walking abilities. The walk takes you through some of the most charming villages on the lake, including: Colonno, Sala Comacina, Ossuccio, Lenno, Mezzegra, Tremezzo and Cadenabbia before arriving at the village of Griante. The path follows some of the old ‘Antica Strada Regina’ and takes you up to some beautiful viewpoints of the lake and through some traditional towns on the mountain side, slightly off the usual tourist trail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent:</strong> 100m</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10km</li>
</ul>
<h3>San Martino Chapel Walk</h3>
<p>The church of San Martino sits at an altitude of 475m on the steep slopes of Sasso San Martino above the village of Griante. An easy path leads up to the church from where you have one of the most beautiful views of the central part of Lake Como. The walk is mostly an ascent up the mountain, but the trails are well-maintained and easy to navigate. You'll pass through wooded areas and come across little religious shrines, dotted along the path. Make sure you read up about the history of the church before you go, in particular its relation to the First World War.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 3 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent:</strong> 100m</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6 kilometres</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rifugio Menaggio</h3>
<p>Rifugio Menaggio (1400 m) is situated on the southern slope of Monte Grona where one can enjoy a spectacular view of Lake Como and the surrounding mountains. From the rifugio you can add on more by hiking to Monte Grona (1736 m) and to Monte Bregagno (2107 m). Or, stop for a drink and a bite to eat in the rifugio, before heading back to the walk starting point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent:</strong> 650m</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10km</li>
<li><strong>Useful Information:</strong> This walk starts from the mountain town of Breglia, which you can get to from Menaggio on the C13 bus line</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bellagio–Brogno–Belvedere di Makallé–Visgnola–Bellagio</h3>
<p>A circular route heading past churches and through rustic villages and forested trails, this walk will take you over to Mount Nuvolone. Literally translated, Mount Nuvolone means Cloud Mountain; so you can imagine how good the views will be from up here! You'll head up to the Belvedere di Makallé which is a fantastic viewpoint with panoramas over the tip of Bellagio.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate-Challenging</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4 hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent:</strong> 550m</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 11km</li>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Poised on the western shore of Lake Como, Menaggio is perfectly placed for summer holidays exploring the promenades, mountains and historic routes of Lake Como]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Walking around Menaggio</h3>
<p>Want to get to know the real Lake Como? Then put on you walking boots and hit the trails above the lake. Walking above and around the lake will open up an entire area of traditional farmland, mountain huts, sleepy old towns and historic churches, that you'd have never seen following the typical tourist trail. The walking above Menaggio really is fantastic and there are many trails to discover on the nearby Monte Grona.</p>
<h3>Exploring ancient streets in Menaggio</h3>
<p>There's nothing nicer than sitting in a cafè in Menaggio's Piazza Garibaldi and soaking up the languid Italian atmosphere with a cappuccino or a gelato in hand. We love wandering along the lakeside promenade, and up and down old streets, wandering into rustic churches like the 17th Century San Stefano, San Carlo and San Giusto along the way. Menaggio is the perfect place to immerse yourself in the classic Italian summer holiday scene and really get to grips with the true meaning of the phrase 'il dolce far niente' ('the sweetness of doing nothing').</p>
<h3>Visiting nearby towns: from Bellagio to Como City</h3>
<p>From the nearby towns of <a data-udi="umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7" href="/{localLink:umb://document/164b7f39f6d74033a2991f5799ebdfa7}" title="Lenno">Lenno</a> and Tremezzo you can easily access the famous Greenway Path or walk up to the Church of San Martino; we highly recommend this walk, not only for the incredible lake views, but for its historical significance, which is worth reading up on. Varenna and <a data-udi="umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d3611d3782e0494ead59e534458bcdd6}" title="Bellagio">Bellagio</a> (The Pearl of Lake Como) are also just a short ferry ride away, and perfect for a day trip These are two of the prettiest towns on Lake Como, adorned with flower lined promenades, historic churches and several lakeside bars and cafès where you can stop for a spot of lunch. Varenna is also home to the Villa Monastero a 12th Century villa turned museum with stunning botanical gardens to explore.</p>
<p>If you head over to Cadenabbia and Tremezzo, then don't miss the Villa Carlotta and its botanical gardens. Built by the Marquis of Milan at the end of the 17th Century and well worth a visit if you're in the area. Como city is also around an hour away on the ferry, which is home to the awe-inspiring Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, built in the Gothic style. The cathedral we see today was completed in the 18th Century and has an intricate Rococo cupola and 15th Century Rose Window, which is a real treat for art history lovers.</p>
<h3>Activities by the lake</h3>
<p>If an active holiday's more your speed then why not walk up to Rifugio Menaggio or rent a bike and try out one of the trails above the lake, or cycle along the lakeside promenade. Alternatively, spend your 'tee-time' at the nearby 18-hole golf course. Lake Como's also great for boat hire and watersports, including sailing boats, skiffs and power boats with skis.</p>
<p>For your cultural fix, the 'plucky' amongst you will appreciate the Menaggio Guitar Festival an annual musical celebration in the centre of town, featuring live music, workshops and a lively communal atmosphere.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Como</h3>
<p>Want to get to know the real Lake Como? Then put on your walking boots and hit the trails above the lake. Walking above and around the lake will open up an entire area of traditional farmland, mountain huts, sleepy old towns and historic churches, that you'd have never seen following the typical tourist trail. There's so much more to Lake Como than just celebrity-spotting or snapping lakeside Instagram photos, and walking is the way to discover the area in a whole new light.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
