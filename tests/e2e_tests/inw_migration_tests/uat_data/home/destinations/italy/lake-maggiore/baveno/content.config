  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Learn the history of the Romanesque Church of San Gervaso and Protaso</li>
<li>Hop between the Borromean Islands; from Isola dei Pescatori to Isola Bella</li>
<li>Walk along the famous Chestnut Route on an Inghams guided walk</li>
</ul>
<p>Baveno stretches along the western shore of <a data-udi="umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48" href="/{localLink:umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48}" title="Lake Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a>, welcoming wanderers and walkers with its mountain-view waterfront. Here, Venetian villas and castle-like hotels have hosted VIP's in the summer for centuries. They’re an elegant backdrop to the lakeside promenade, where boats bound for the nearby Borromean Islands leave the harbour. Back in town, the parks and villa gardens of Baveno are made for walking, while more challenging paths climb into the Alps behind. See some bald patches on the slopes? They’re the famous quarries that have supplied pink granite to the churches and opera houses of Paris, Milan and Rome.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in Baveno</h3>
<p>There’s plenty to peruse while exploring Baveno. The round, Romanesque Church of San Gervaso and Protaso with its characteristic six-storey bell tower sits on the Piazza della Chiesa, filled with frescoes and a quarry museum. Some of the villas come with grand public gardens. And the cafés that line the waterfront between the port and harbour are a great place to pause… preferably for a bite to eat; perhaps a board of mortadella salami and herby alpine cheese? As for the best ice cream – duck into the cobbled streets of the old town for a scoop of pistachio gelato or sorbet-like granita.</p>
<h3>Exploring Lake Maggiore: Boats to the Borromean Islands</h3>
<p>The Borromean Islands lie just across the water, best reached by the ferries – or, if you fancy travelling off-schedule, the water taxis that depart from Baveno’s harbour. In the summer sun travelling on the ferry is one of the best ways to see Lake Maggiore. Each island has its own speciality. Isola Bella and Isola Madre lay out palaces with extravagant gardens (keep an eye out for the wandering peacocks). Isola dei Pescatori is home to the last remaining fishing boats on the islands, plus restaurants serving fresh lake fish dishes.</p>
<h3>Walking through history</h3>
<p>Baveno is truly a beloved resort town, and the countryside around it hints at its peaceful past. Walking routes zig-zag uphill through hamlets and past chestnut forests, and along old mule tracks once used by fishermen. Simpler strolls stick to the lakeside promenade, heading north to the ancient port and village of Feriolo. Remember to carve out time for some culture and stop by the monument dedicated to the “picasass” stonemasons en route. These workers have long toiled in the quarries above Baveno, carving out the building blocks for some of the loveliest opera houses, churches and arcades in Europe.</p>
<h3>All about adventure: from Lake Maggiore to Milan</h3>
<p>Treetop walking, suspension bridges, climbing walls, pools and a cyclo-cross course will keep you busy at Lake Maggiore Aquadventure Park - particularly if you have teenagers with you! If watersports are more your speed, there are wakeboarding and boating centres on the lake too. And you don’t need a car for a day trip. <a data-udi="umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b}" title="Stresa">Stresa</a> is only a few minutes away by train – or you can embark on a mini-adventure to Milan, which is less than two hours away on the historic Simplon railway line.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Baveno with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Baveno's best activities at your own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>Plus, we've included two optional <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063" href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/walking-holidays/guided-walks" target="_blank" title="Guided Walks">guided walks</a> every week in Baveno. Join a professional mountain guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</span></p>
<p><span>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Baveno include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</span></p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Ferries</h3>
<p>The hydro-foil ferries in Lake Maggiore are extremely useful and more eco-friendly than your average ferry! They're perfect for hopping over to the Borromean islands for a day trip. Check out those sparkling waters as you drift along the lake. Many of our hotels are close to ferry landing points, so you won't have far to go.</p>
<h3>Buses &amp; trains</h3>
<p>Baveno's bus network is really useful for exploring towns like <a data-udi="umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b}" title="Stresa">Stresa</a> which takes around eight minutes on the bus. You can usually buy tickets in a nearby tabaccheria or on the bus itself. You can also get the train to nearby towns such as Belgirate, with its little Romanesque church of St Mary dating back to the 11th Century. This journey only takes about 10 minutes direct.</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>If you'd rather walk, it doesn't take long to walk along the lakeside to picture perfect towns such as Feriolo with its little beaches and quaint harbours. This walk only takes about 50 minutes.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Il Sentiero Azzurro</h3>
<p>Walk up to the Romanesque stone church of St Giovanni in the field - worth having a look to see if it's open. Once you get to the Belvedere viewing point you'll get some incredible views of Lake Maggiore, The Borromean Gulf and the mouth of the River Toce, so it's worth taking a minute and soaking it all in. The trail is signposted for some of the way as the Sentiero Azzurro and if you follow it after the viewpoint, you'll come to a lakeside path with sections shaded by trees. Make sure you take some time to visit the archaeological museum along the lakeside path, and take a moment to sit in one of the relaxing lakeside cafe's for a coffee or a spritz!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Useful Information: </strong>To start the walk you can hop on a train to Verbania/Pallanza from Baveno and then you'll walk to Mergozzo town via Montorfano. Don't forget to validate your ticket on the platform before hopping on the train!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Villa Lesa - Monte Alle Croci - Belgirate</h3>
<p>Starting in the relaxed town of Lesa this walk gives you a diverse range of things to see along the way. Stroll through the ancient villages of the Upper Vergante, stumble across farmhouses and churches and head into the foothills around Lake Maggiore, passing the Erno stream as well as historic villages, villas and gardens on the way. The walk is about 11.5km long and has about 480 metres of ascent, so requires a very good fitness level. The walk ends in Belgirate, where you can grab a train directly back to Baveno, this is about 11 minutes direct.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Useful Information:</strong> Hop on the train from Baveno to Lesa where the walk starts, the journey only takes about 15 minutes direct.</li>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Baveno is a beautiful, relaxed base for exploring Lake Maggiore, the Borromean Islands and walking along the panoramic footpaths of the Piedmont]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Learn about local history</h3>
<p>If you're into history, the Romanesque church of Baveno San Gervasio e Protasio's a must see. The church dates back to the 14th Century and was consecrated by the Viscount Guglielmo Amidano on 13 May 1343. You could also hop on a ferry and visit the Roman town of Pallanza; home to artefacts dating back to the 1st Century! It's crammed full of colourful period buildings and a Romanesque basilica, the church of Madonna di Campagna, which has architectural features dating back to the 16th Century. </p>
<h3>Go island hopping</h3>
<p>A trip to Baveno wouldn't be complete without visiting at least one of the three Borromean Islands. The Isola Bella's the most famous island and was turned into an Italian terraced garden in the 17th Century by the Borromeo family. It's so beautiful that it's inspired writers and poets throughout time. Dickens wrote, "However fanciful and fantastic Isola Bella may be, and is, it is still beautiful". Isola Madre's the biggest island and has peacocks strutting around its' gardens. Check out the villa and its classic Italian style. The third island, Isola dei Pescatori is a lot more down to earth. It's an old fishing island and still is today. This is where Maggiore gets it's delicious fresh fish. It's easy to get to these islands on the ferry (services reduce to weekends only in October) or by water taxi.</p>
<h3>Indulge in food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>Primi piatti tend to be pasta or risotto dishes (in true Italian style), but for secondi you have to try out the fresh fish straight from the Adriatic Sea. Fish is a staple of the region and a delicious way to enjoy your evening meals. Cheese and cured meats are also fantastic in Lake Maggiore. They have the perfect mountain climate and conditions to raise healthy cattle. Try the local Mortadella dell'Ossola a speciality cured meat and the local Ossolana d'Alpe or Bettelmatt cheeses.</p>
<h3>Try out local activities</h3>
<p>If you love the water then Baveno has a great lido for swimming or you could do some water sports on the lake. There's loads to do if you want an activity packed holiday! For the sightseeing part of your holiday you can't miss the Villa Fedora public park. Lake Maggiore's known for it's botanical gardens and the 18th Century Pallavicino park's no exception. It's a wildlife park and botanical garden and a great place to walk around and check out the exotic plants and the 50 species of mammals and birds that live there.</p>]]></thingsToDo>
