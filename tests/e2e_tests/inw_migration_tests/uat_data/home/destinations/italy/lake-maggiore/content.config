  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lake Maggiore is the second largest lake in Italy, snaking a path from the Alps to the Mediterranean plains on the southern shore. It’s so big, in fact, that it pops its head over the Swiss border. These shifting landscapes are ideal for walkers, as footpaths range from the sculpted palazzo gardens of the Borromean Islands to rugged wilderness areas. The varying micro-climates also produce delicious ingredients – lemons, olives and alpine cheeses. <a data-udi="umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005" href="/{localLink:umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005}" title="Baveno">Baveno</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b}" title="Stresa">Stresa</a> on the north-westerly shore make great bases for a summer holiday; with excellent ferry and train links to the rest of <a data-udi="umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48" href="/{localLink:umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48}" title="Lake Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland.</a></p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Lake Maggiore: A range of rambles</h3>
<p>Walking in Lake Maggiore ranges from strolling along flower-lined promenades in the summer to heading off on adventurous mountain routes. The walk from Stresa to Passera is a superb introduction, weaving wanderers through forests and the villages of Brisino, Falchetto and Belgirate. Fondotoce Nature Reserve, meanwhile, offers 5km of hiking and cycling paths through lakeside marshes with mountain views.</p>
<p>Got a head for heights? Set your sights on Mottarone (1,491m). The Chestnut Route (Sentiero dei Castagni) also starts from Stresa, where cobbled footpaths climb to a viewpoint from which you can see seven Italian and Swiss lakes on a clear day. Or there’s always the trails of Val Grande National Park – Italy’s biggest wilderness area.</p>
<h3>Stay west: Stresa and Baveno</h3>
<p>Most summer holidays to Lake Maggiore are based in the towns of Stresa and Baveno, on the westerly Gulf of Borromeo. As the locale suggests, they’re brilliantly poised for trips to the Borromean Islands opposite them. And although the towns are neighbours, they offer two very different ways of life. Baveno is the quiet one, ideal for a leisurely <em>passeggiata</em> along the promenade peppered with cafés, villas and gardens. Stresa is the popular one – and has been for centuries, with writers and royalty staying in its grand hotels and villas.</p>
<h3>Exploring the Borromean Islands</h3>
<p>The Borromean Islands are a cluster of tiny isles at the centre of Lake Maggiore and a popular sight to see in the summer. Boats glide to the gardens and summer palaces of Isola Bella and Isola Madre. Isola dei Pescatori is the only permanently inhabited island, with a population of barely 25 villagers. Some still make their living from fishing, sharing their catch with the clutch of waterside restaurants frequented by day-trippers. To get to the Borromean Islands, hop on a ferry from Stresa or Baveno.</p>
<h3>From Lake Maggiore to Milan and the mountains</h3>
<p>Getting around Lake Maggiore is half the pleasure. Ferries, trains and buses usher hikers between lakefront towns and villages all summer long. Day trips include wine tasting in the vineyards of Piedmont and exploring peaceful Lake Orta, which is tucked away amongst the forested foothills just west. And <a data-udi="umb://document/2575554a5b50446eb00d5bf533f317cd" href="/{localLink:umb://document/2575554a5b50446eb00d5bf533f317cd}" title="Milan">Milan</a> is an hour’s drive south. The marble quarries north of Lake Maggiore provided the building blocks for the architectural extravaganza that is Milan Cathedral. For more in the way of natural wonders, hop north over the border to Switzerland to marvel at some of the highest mountains in the Alps.</p>

  <inAround><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Lake Maggiore</h2>
<p>Fill your days on Lake Maggiore exploring the lakeside towns and villages or venture into the hills on a walk. Ferries connect Stresa and Baveno to the beautiful Borromean Islands and its fantastic botanical gardens. You'll find lot's to see and do around the lake. When you're not out seeing the sights, find a lakeside restaurant or café where you can sit back and admire the scenery with an Aperol Spritz in hand. </p>
<p>Nature enthusiasts will love the beautiful botanical gardens on the shores of Lake Maggiore. See the 17th century ‘Italian garden’ of Isola Bella and the rare plants and flowers in the palace gardens of Isola Madre – its known for its flowering azaleas. Keen gardeners will enjoy exploring Verbania – known as ‘the garden on the lake’, home to the botanical gardens of Villa Taranto.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>Lake Maggiore won't disappoint when it comes to food. Try the traditional antipasto: speciality cured meats, fresh breads, pickles and cheeses. The local cheeses are a delicacy - give the Ossolano d'Alpe and the Bettelmatt a try while you're here. This is the perfect starter or afternoon snack, best accompanied by a glass of local wine like Nebbiolo - a full bodied red from the Novara hills. There's lots of lovely restaurants to choose from in Stresa and Baveno, from authentic Italian Osteria to fine dining. Fish features on most menus with dishes like grilled seafood and cod stuffed ravioli. You'll notice lots of traditional pastry shops as you explore the region. Each bakery has its own specialities - we couldn't resist the sweet short crust Margheritine biscuits in Stresa.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>If hiking up steep paths in pursuit of views is your thing, you can hike the Chestnut Route (Sentiero dei Castagni) up Mount Mottarone from Stresa, which takes about 2 hours 40 minutes one way. The views are amazing– you can see seven of the Italian and Swiss lakes on a clear day! On your evening strolls don't miss the flower lined, lakefront promenades. One of our favourite walks from Stresa is through the hamlet of Passera - the route weaves through the forest to the villages of Passera, Brisino, Falchetto and Belgirate.</p>]]></inAround>
