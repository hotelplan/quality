  <description><![CDATA[<h3>Discover Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>Lake Maggiore is the second largest lake in Italy, snaking a path from the Alps to the Mediterranean plains on the southern shore. It’s so big, in fact, that it pops its head over the Swiss border. These shifting landscapes are ideal for walkers in the summer, as footpaths range from the sculpted palazzo gardens of the Borromean Islands to rugged wilderness areas. <a data-udi="umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005" href="/{localLink:umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005}" title="Baveno">Baveno</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b}" title="Stresa">Stresa</a> on the north-westerly shore make great bases for a summer holiday, with excellent ferry and train links to the rest of <a data-udi="umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48" href="/{localLink:umb://document/476c8caf3fe84faab565f2d0f2e99f48}" title="Lake Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland.</a></p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>Walking in Lake Maggiore ranges from strolling along flower-lined promenades in the summer to heading off on adventurous mountain routes. The walk from Stresa to Passera is a superb introduction, weaving wanderers through forests and the villages of Brisino, Falchetto and Belgirate. Fondotoce Nature Reserve, meanwhile, offers 5km of hiking and cycling paths through lakeside marshes with mountain views.</p>
<p>Got a head for heights? Set your sights on Mottarone (1,491m). The Chestnut Route (Sentiero dei Castagni) also starts from Stresa, where cobbled footpaths climb to a viewpoint from which you can see seven Italian and Swiss lakes on a clear day. Or there’s always the trails of Val Grande National Park – Italy’s biggest wilderness area.</p>
<h3>Relaxing in Stresa and Baveno</h3>
<p>Our summer holidays in Lake Maggiore are based in the towns of Stresa and Baveno, on the westerly Gulf of Borromeo. As the locale suggests, they’re brilliantly poised for trips to the Borromean Islands opposite them. And although the towns are neighbours, they offer two very different ways of life. Baveno is the quiet one, ideal for a leisurely 'passeggiata'<em>, </em>walking along the promenade peppered with cafés, villas and gardens. Stresa is the popular one – and has been throughout the summer for centuries, with writers and royalty staying in its grand hotels and villas.</p>
<h3>Activities in Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>One of our favourite activities in Lake Maggiore is exploring the famous Borromean Islands. The islands are a cluster of tiny isles at the centre of Lake Maggiore and a popular sight to see on your summer holiday. Boats glide to the gardens and the summer palaces of Isola Bella and Isola Madre. Isola dei Pescatori is the only permanently inhabited island, with a population of barely 25 villagers. Some still make their living from fishing, sharing their catch with the clutch of waterside restaurants frequented by day-trippers. We love walking around the islands and exploring the nooks and crannies of the ancient streets and beautifully curated garden landscapes. To get to the Borromean Islands, hop on a ferry from Stresa or Baveno.</p>
<h3>Things to do around Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>In Lake Maggiore ferries, trains and buses usher walkers between lakefront towns and villages all summer long. Day trips include wine tastings in the vineyards of Piedmont and walking around peaceful Lake Orta, which is tucked away amongst the forested foothills to the west. Milan is an hour’s drive to the south; head there for the day and gaze at the stunning Milan Cathedral or explore the shops in the famous Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The marble quarries north of Lake Maggiore provided the building blocks for the architectural extravaganza that is Milan Cathedral. For more in the way of natural wonders, hop north over the border to Switzerland to marvel at some of the highest mountains in the Alps.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink in Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>Lake Maggiore's varying micro-climates produce delicious ingredients – lemons, olives and alpine cheeses. Being on the border with Switzerland the local cheese is some of the best around; famous for its traditional cow's milk cheese, Ossolano dell'Alpe and of course who could forget Gorgonzola! If you hop over to Isola dei Pescatori, one of the most untouched of the Borromean Islands, make sure you try the fresh fish. The island definitely lives up to its name, Fisherman's Island, and is a great example of locals keeping traditional industries alive.</p>

  <inAround><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Lake Maggiore</h2>
<p>Fill your days in Lake Maggiore exploring the lakeside towns and villages or venture into the hills and surrounding mountains in search of some fantastic walking routes. Ferries connect <a data-udi="umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/44b05c95e1264c56b51016621b99f80b}" title="Stresa">Stresa</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005" href="/{localLink:umb://document/40af41087b6c40cd950bbe672939b005}" title="Baveno">Baveno</a> to the beautiful Borromean Islands and its botanical gardens; the gardens come alive in the summer with a colourful array of flowers and the calling of Peacocks. When you're not out sightseeing, find a lakeside restaurant or café where you can sit back, enjoying the local food and drink and admiring the scenery with an Aperol Spritz in hand. </p>
<p>Nature enthusiasts will love the beautiful botanical gardens on the shores of Lake Maggiore. Explore the 17th century Isola Bella and the rare plants and flowers in the palace gardens of Isola Madre – its known for its flowering azaleas, perfectly in bloom in the summer months. Keen gardeners will enjoy visiting Verbania – known as ‘the garden on the lake’, home to the botanical gardens of Villa Taranto.</p>
<h3>Lake and mountain fare: food &amp; drink in Lake Maggiore</h3>
<p>Lake Maggiore won't disappoint when it comes to food. Try the traditional antipasti: speciality cured meats, fresh breads, pickles and cheeses. The local cheeses are a delicacy - give the Ossolano d'Alpe and the Bettelmatt a try while you're here. This is the perfect starter or afternoon snack, best accompanied by a glass of local wine like Nebbiolo - a full bodied red from the Novara hills. There's lots of lovely restaurants to choose from in Stresa and Baveno, from authentic Italian Osterie to fine dining. Fish features on most menus with dishes like grilled seafood and cod stuffed ravioli; one of the best things to eat on a warm summer's day. You'll notice lots of traditional pastry shops as you explore the region. Each bakery has its own specialities - we couldn't resist the sweet short crust Margheritine biscuits in Stresa, walking around the towns is the best way to find hidden culinary gems.</p>
<h3>Walking in the Italian Lake District</h3>
<p>If walking up steep paths in pursuit of lake and mountain views is up your street, you can walk the Chestnut Route (Sentiero dei Castagni) up Mount Mottarone from Stresa, which takes about 2 hours 40 minutes one way. The views of the lake from the mountain are amazing– you can see seven of the Italian and Swiss lakes on a clear day! On your evening strolls don't miss the flower lined, lakefront promenades. One of our favourite walks from Stresa is through the hamlet of Passera - the route weaves through the forest to the villages of Passera, Brisino, Falchetto and Belgirate.</p>]]></inAround>
