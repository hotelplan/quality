  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>With the Mont Blanc on your doorstep, it’s no wonder the walking trails offer fantastic scenery</li>
<li>Chamonix’s full of summer activities with a lively town centre</li>
<li>Tuck into tasty Savoyard cuisine and enjoy hearty local dishes with rich flavours</li>
</ul>
<p>Chamonix is a holiday destination on every mountain-lover’s bucket list, a working town (rather than sleepy resort village) that’s as busy in summer as it is in winter. Because of the mega mountains that surround it (Chamonix sits at the foot of the Mont Blanc massif, to name just one) and the extreme athletes that come here to play, it’s known as the adventure capital of Europe. But for the rest of us, those towering mountain peaks and the lush valleys make the most breath-taking backdrop for hiking, biking or simply relaxing.</p>
<h3>Panoramic views on the trails within the Tour du Mont Blanc</h3>
<p>Take the Aiguille du Midi cable car that whisks you up the Mont Blanc massif to the top of Europe. It’s worth it for the views alone, with panoramic views of the French, Swiss and Italian Alps. Visit the museum or watch mountaineers set out for the summit.</p>
<p>In fact, the Chamonix valley has one of the best summer lift systems in the Alps, with cable cars, gondolas, funiculars and chairlifts to give you a boost on your hike or bike, or easy access to new areas for sightseeing (payable locally and open during selected dates, see 'walking' tab below for further information on summer lifts).</p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Chamonix</h3>
<p>A summer hiking destination since the mid 1700s, and positioned on the Tour du Mont Blanc, Chamonix has a huge complex of trails, whatever your pace. The Lac Blanc is a popular walking trail, it's well-marked and offers stellar views. If you’re up for more of a challenge, the Grand Balcon Sud day hike will lead you through forests, meadows and high alpine terrain. Look out for traditional mountain refuges along the routes for refreshments.</p>
<h3>Explore the Mer de Glace (the Sea of Ice)</h3>
<p>The largest glacier in France - 7 kilometres long and 200 metres deep - it was the Mer de Glace that put Chamonix on the map as a holiday destination back in the 1800s. Although fast receding, during certain summer months you can visit the caves inside this living glacier, with its ice sculptures and crystals, as well as the Glacorium exhibition museum nearby that’s dedicated to glaciology.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Chamonix</h3>
<p>Adventure parks, zip lines and outdoor activities. The Chamonix valley has no shortage of kids’ activities. Families after a holiday in nature will love Chamonix, the walking routes are beautiful and range from valley level walking to more challenging hikes, for kids up to the task. The adventure and leisure parks are great fun for all, as is the Montenver train. See our 'things to do' tab for more information on family activities.</p>
<h3>Adventure-sport central</h3>
<p>There’s probably no more active or adventurous place in the world with many different activities on offer as well as events throughout the summer. Explore the extensive walking trails, or, perhaps find a sunny deck to watch all the action from…</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Petit Balcon Nord - Argentiere to Les Bois</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy to moderate walk</li>
<li>12 kilometres</li>
<li>Expect to take around four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fantastic walk for the mornings. Head off after breakfast and be back in time for lunch. Walk through forests and flower-filled fields and look out for cows and goats as you go along. The walk is relatively flat with a few gentle inclines and some downhill sections.</p>
<h3>Lac des Gaillands</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy, family-friendly walk</li>
<li>Two kilometres long</li>
<li>Expect to take around half an hour</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk is a great way to warm up your legs at the beginning of the holiday. It's a flat walk around the lake so it's nothing too strenuous for after you've been travelling. This is a great opportunity to get to know the area at the start of the holiday and a chance to think about what your next adventure will be.</p>
<h3>Cascade du Dard</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>Circular trail of 4.7 kilometres</li>
<li>Expect to take around two and a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This hike is brilliant if you want something slightly more challenging. You'll pass through a forest and end up with fantastic views of the 20 metre high waterfall, Cascade du Dard. There's also a nice café near the waterfall. The walk starts with a steep ascent and some of the paths have quite a loose surface so make sure you have shoes with a good grip on.</p>
<h3>Les Praz to Lac Blanc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>Part of the tour de Mont Blanc</li>
<li>6.1 kilometres long</li>
<li>Expect to take around three hours</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll find incredible views over the Chamonix Aiguilles, Les Drus and La Verte. Take the Flégère cable car and begin your climb up to the Lac Blanc. There's a mountain refuge on route where you can stop for refreshments. Once you get to the Lac Blanc, walk around for gorgeous views of the Mont Blanc Massif.</p>
<h3>Grand Balcon Nord, Plan de l'Aiguille to Montenvers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>High altitude</li>
<li>Approx. 15 kilometres</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're heading up in the Aiguille du Midi cable car then this is the perfect walk to make the most of those high altitudes. On the cable car journey back from the summit you can get off at the mid-station and this is where the walk begins. You're heading for Montenvers where you'll find the famous Mer de Glace and the Montenvers train which you can take to get back down to Chamonix, the Mont Blanc is behind you on this walk so make sure to stop and look back to take in those breath-taking views. Please note that during parts of the summer season some areas of this route can be covered in snow which can be dangerous, always check conditions prior to walking.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

<h3>Admire spectacular views of Mont Blanc and Mer de Glace</h3>
<p>No summer holiday in Chamonix is complete without a ride on one of the world's highest cable cars, the Aiguille du Midi cable car. Once you reach the top station on the Aiguille du Midi, you'll be greeted with fantastic views of the surrounding snow-capped peaks of the Mont Blanc Massif (as well as chillier temperatures). Another fantastic way to journey into the mountains is to hop on the famous Montenvers cog railway. You'll ascend to 1,913 metres to see the stunning Mer de Glace glacier. You can even book to spend a cosy night in the <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/7c89165bd6bc4b71a5a7b533930f895e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7c89165bd6bc4b71a5a7b533930f895e}" target="_blank" title="Refuge de Montenvers - Overnight Glacier Experience">Refuge du Montenvers</a>. </p>

Activities are all bookable and payable locally and we advise checking opening times and dates beforehand as these can be subject to change.</p>\n<h3>Montenvers train</h3>\n<p>Those looking for a gentle journey into the mountains will enjoy the Montenvers train. This delightful cog railway takes you on a gentle journey up the mountain, overlooking the Chamonix valley until you reach the Mer de Glace.</p>\n<p>You can stop at this point and just admire the views before enjoying the train journey back down, or during certain summer months the Ice Caves open. The Ice Caves are carved into the Mer de Glace glacier and are vibrant blue tunnels winding through the ice. You'll also find various ice sculptures inside, usually carved into the shape of animals or characters.</p>\n<p>To get to the ice caves you take a small gondola down from the Montenver train and then there is a long walk way with a lot of steps to get down to the caves, the walk can take around 30 minutes and you do the same walk in reverse on the way up. </p>\n<h3>Leisure parks and activities</h3>\n<p>Chamonix Leisure park<strong> - </strong>This leisure park, not far from Chamonix town centre is great fun for kids of all ages. You'll find play areas, carousels, water games, mini karting and the alpine coaster, the luge. </p>\n<p>Adventure park: Accro Park of Les Gaillands<strong> - </strong>Just outside of Chamonix you'll find this adventure park. Situated in the Gaillands forest, you'll find playgrounds, high ropes courses, small ziplines as well as picnic areas.</p>\n<h3>Excursions</h3>\n<p>For older children or those that are particularly active, they may be interested in some of our excursions that are bookable locally, which include white water rafting, canyoning and e-biking to name a few. See the 'excursion tab' above for more information, age restrictions apply.</p>"

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended Equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, waterproofs, insect repellent, rucksacks, walking poles and a re-usable water bottle are useful for hiking around Chamonix. You may want to pack warm jackets and trousers if you're planning to use the higher altitude cable cars as it can be cold at the top.</p>
<h3>Walking Apps &amp; Maps</h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.chamonix.com/usual-information-services/chamonix-mobile-app" target="_blank">Chamonix official app</a> is really useful and a brilliant addition to your holiday. It has information about the lifts and their opening times, local bars and restaurants, walking trails, cultural days out, public transport, local tourist offices and more.</p>
<h3>Hiking Guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't over-estimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p><span>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</span></p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Chamonix</h3>
<p>Its hard to escape the eye of the Mont Blanc when walking in Chamonix (not that you'll want to), the views are breath-taking and there are walks for all abilities. With Chamonix being one of the towns to sit on the famous Tour du Mont Blanc it's no wonder walking and hiking are a way of life here. You're not short on trails, whether you want to take advantage of the summer lifts to get higher into the mountains (open during selected dates and payable locally) or stick to the valley, there's no shortage of beautiful scenery in this area.</p>
<h3>Inghams guided walks</h3>
<p><span>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of Inghams guests.
