  <description><![CDATA[<p>Surrounded by meadows and forests and set against the Gratlspitz peaks, Alpbach is a village from the pages of a fairy tale. Wooden houses with flower-filled balconies decorate peaceful streets, while many of the surrounding farms have been run by the same families for centuries. This makes it one of the best places for digging into mountain food – just the fuel you need for hiking. Gondolas glide up to mountain tracks, footpaths meander along meadows and valleys, and three gorges line up some seriously dramatic vistas.</p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Alpbachtal</h3>
<p>There are around 900 kilometres of marked paths around Alpbach – and the Wiedersbergerhorn gondola is a great introduction to them. It whisks walkers up to the highest slopes above Alpbach, where some of the most beautiful hikes in the Kitzbühel Alps unroll. For more of a challenge, clamber to one of the three peaks of Gratlspitze mountain for views into the valley far below. There are also plenty of wanders between the villages, farmsteads and serene chapels along the valley floor. Not sure where to begin? Join a guided walking tour from the tourist office.</p>
<h3>Alpbach Valley style</h3>
<p>Many of the houses, shops and cafés in Alpbach haven’t changed since the first log was laid. They all showcase a distinct woodcarving technique that shapes everything from gables and altars to the furniture in hotels and restaurants. However, one building has broken the mould. The Congress Centre - which hosts the annual scientific and political European Forum Alpbach - blends into the mountainside like a glass Hobbit house.</p>
<p>Architecture isn’t the only thing special about Alpbach. Alpbachtal Hüttenjause food platters lay out Tyrolean specialities such as mountain sausages and hay-milk cheese (tastier than it sounds). Most ingredients are plucked from the farms of the Alpbach Valley, some of which have been in the same family for over 300 years. Go to the Alpine Farmers’ Museum, about a 20-minute bus ride away, to see how people lived in centuries past.</p>
<h3>Family holidays: mountain coasters and enchanted forests</h3>
<p>Alpbach is a paradise for young children - the Wiedersbergerhorn lift is the gateway to Lauserland – a mountain playground with an alpine rollercoaster, panoramic towers and rope courses. Further along the Alpbach Valley, another lift goes from Reith im Alpbachtal to the tree swings and wobbly bridges of Juppi’s Enchanted Forest. Reith is also the spot for swimming in the village’s picturesque lake.</p>
<h3>Gorge hikes and exploring on bikes</h3>
<p>There are three gorge walks within easy reach of Alpbach. A 1.5-hour ramble along Tiefenbach Gorge winds past a turquoise river and otherworldly rock formations, the speedy waters of the Kaiser Gorge are a favourite with white-water rafters and experienced kayakers, and the Kundl Gorge lays out an easy path along one of the most dramatic canyons in Austria. </p>
<p>Cyclists are in their element in Alpbach too, with routes including forest tracks, high-altitude paths between mountain huts and quiet mountain roads.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Family friendly walks</h3>
<p>There’s plenty of walks that will interest the children, and you can usually reward them with a playground at the end. Try the panorama path, or walk to the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn mountain – the ascent is only 300 metres so it’s manageable for keen adventurers. Or head to the pushchair-friendly Kundl gorge, see what discoveries you can make on the path of contemplation or head to Juppi’s enchanted forest.</p>
<h3>Lauserland adventure playground and coaster</h3>
<p>At the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn gondola, Lauserland is a mountain-top adventure world with enough play areas to keep the children entertained for hours – from rope courses and climbing frames to rolling ball tracks and water games, even a jumping pillow. For adults, there’s shaded rest areas and hammocks to enjoy the view. Feeling brave? Whizz down the mountain on the Lauser-Sauser summer toboggan – a top attraction for all ages.</p>
<h3>Juppi’s enchanted forest</h3>
<p>Make mud pies in the forest kitchen, balance on the wobbly bridge and complete challenges like swing bowling. Juppi’s enchanted forest is hidden away at the top of the Reither Kogel, and is full of surprises – grab a treasure map and hunt out the best play areas and viewing spots, and make sure your family hike is full of fun – the kids can collect stamps along the way and get a small present from the bottom station of the lift.</p>
<h3>Alpbachtal family programme</h3>
<p>With the family program you can get closer to nature and enjoy some family time in the mountains. It runs Monday to Friday, from the start of July to the end of August and is included in the Alpbachtal Summer Card – every day is a different adventure to share with your children (parental supervision is required at all times).</p>
<h3>Alpbachtal treasure map</h3>
<p>The treasure map shows all the fun things going on around the area for families to get involved with, from Juppi’s enchanted forest and Lauserland, to adventures a little further afield, there’s plenty to keep little ones entertained and the Alpbachtal Card makes exploring the area easy.</p>]]></festivals>

<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>4km with 195m of height gain</li>
<li>The walk takes around one and a half hours (plus stops for lots of pictures)</li>
</ul>
<p>A great walk for the views, this route circumnavigates the Wiedersbergerhorn peak and can be done in either direction – the views are great the whole way and the path gently undulates. A detour up to the peak itself is a worthy detour.</p>
<h3>Alpbach Höhenweg</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>6.5km with around 240m of height gain</li>
<li>The walk takes one and a half to two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Alpbach is one of Austria’s prettiest villages, and this route takes you past some of the most picturesque farm buildings in the valley – many of them have been in the same family for hundreds of years.</p>
<h3>Three-peak-tour</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>6.3km with around 540m height gain</li>
<li>The walk will take around three hours</li>

<h3>Alpbach Nature and Heritage Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>5.2km with around 200m height gain</li>
<li>The walk will take around one and a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>On this walk you’ll get an insight into the history of Alpbach, the life of the locals and the wildlife of the valley. It’s follows part of the Path of Contemplation and then loops around the village - a popular route for families but it’s suitable for pushchairs.</p>
<h3>Alpbachtal pastures from Reitherkogel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>9.1km with around 530m height gain</li>
<li>The walk will take around three and a half hours (plus stops for snacks and photos)</li>
</ul>

Along the way, the views are spectacular over the mountains and valleys.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Enjoy a summer holiday in Alpbach - one of Austria's most beautiful villages, where charming wooden houses remain frozen in time]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Take a dip in outdoor pools and bathing lakes</h3>
<p>Cool down from the summer sun in one of the many swimming areas in Alpbachtal. Lake Reintal is the warmest and largest in the area and is also the starting point for several beautiful walks. Children will love the bathing lake at Reith, which has a spacious lawn and play area. Discover the hidden gem of Lake Berglstein, in the middle of the forest – its idyllic location is perfect for enjoying nature, peace and quiet, and the picturesque wooden hut on the shore makes the perfect photo. There’s also outdoor pools in Münster and Brixlegg.</p>
<h3>Gorges and canyons</h3>
<p>Get a unique experience in nature in one of the impressive gorges of the Teifenbach, Kaiser or Kundl. Turquoise green waters cascade over unusual rock formations in the Tiefenbach Gorge, while the Kaiser Gorge is popular with families, with picnic areas and imposing bridges and tunnels. For an adrenaline kick, you can also get involved in water sports in the gorges too, from white water swimming and tube riding, to rafting or kayaking.</p>
<h3>Visit Rattenberg</h3>
<p>The medieval town of glass, Rattenberg sits on the bank of the River Inn and only has around 500 inhabitants – despite its small size, it’s packed with culture and is famous for glass-blowing. Pop into the Kisslinger shop to see demos of the craft of glass-blowing and marvel at some of the works of art that have been created there. Wander the river path or the colourful cobbled street, tuck into an apple strudel from Hacker,  enjoy the view from the Schlossberg or see historical art treasures in the Augustinian museum.</p>
<h3>Tyrolean Farmhouse Museum in Kramsach</h3>
<p>Take a step back in time at the Tyrolean Farmhouse Museum, where historic buildings have been painstakingly reconstructed to give a glimpse into the Tyrol’s farming past. Each building is unique and beautiful, and has been painstakingly rebuilt exactly as it was in its original location.</p>
<h3>Explore the Alpbachtal by bike</h3>
<p>Bike lovers will feel at home in the Alpbachtal, which has trails to suit all two-wheel enthusiasts from gravel trails, mountain bike trail and picturesque mountain roads. It’s location means exploring neighbouring valleys is easy too, and there’s battery charging points for topping up the power in your e-bike – plus rental is available often with discounts thanks to your Alpbachtal Card.</p>
<h3>Activities in the Alpbachtal</h3>
<p>You’ll not be short of things to do in the Alpbachtal – along side the hundreds of kilometres of walking and biking trails, you can try some via feratta, or practice your navigation with some geocaching. Or, why not get up higher for the very best view of the valley on a paraglide.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Alpbach and the surrounding area. There's a few places in Alpbach to buy walking equipment.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 428 for Alpbach and the surrounding area, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the hiking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<p>The tourist office can also provide local maps and information on walking routes.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Alpbach</h3>
<p>The Alpbachtal area has received the Austrian Hiking Seal of Quality, so you know it must be good. There’s over 900 kilometres of marked walking trails to explore in the area that cater for all abilities, whether it’s a leisurely wander to a gourmet mountain hut that takes your fancy, or you’re keen to bag as many of the local summits as possible. From forest trails, and picturesque Alpine meadows, to rugged peaks, gorges and spots that are just perfect for enjoying the sunset, in Alpbach, there’s walking to suit everyone. Best of all, you get free use of the walker’s lifts and buses thanks to the Alpbachtal Card which is given to you by your hotel on arrival.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The Alpbachtal Card is packed with summer benefits, including the opportunity to join guided walks that are hosted by the tourist office and offered either free of charge, or at a discounted rate, to Alpbachtal Card holders. See the “Cards &amp; passes” tab for more information on the Alpbachtal Card’s benefits.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
