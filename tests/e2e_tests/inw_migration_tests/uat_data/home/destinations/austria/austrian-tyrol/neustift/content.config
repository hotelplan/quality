  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Take the cable-car to the Top of Tyrol for spectacular glacier views</li>
<li>Hike to the impressive Grawa Waterfall</li>
<li>Visit Innsbruck and see the famous Golden Roof</li>
</ul>
<p>Neustift village sits in the heart of the Stubai Valley, framed by pine forested slopes and an icy turquoise river. This region has long welcomed those who love to launch themselves into the mountains at full pelt. In summer, it casts off its legendary winter sports scene, replacing pistes with footpaths and après-ski with aperitifs. Hiking, cycling, paragliding, swimming and summer tobogganing are all great ways to explore this spectacular corner of the Tyrol. The trusty valley buses also make the half-hour journey to Innsbruck. Plus, at the end of the valley is the grandest of grand finales – the vast Stubai Glacier.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Neustift</h3>
<p>Neustift draws in the lively – those ready to use it as a base for exploring the mountains and valleys beyond. Paragliders drift overhead and the mountains are always in sight, best viewed from a terrace with a local pine-infused cola or elderflower spritz in hand. The Elfer cable car trundles from Neustift up the Elferspitze mountain, leading the way to easy woodland strolls, panoramic paths between mountain huts and hair-raising via ferrata routes.</p>
<h3>To the Top of Tyrol: the Stubai Glacier</h3>
<p>A 30-minute bus journey takes you to the gondolas of the vast Stubai Glacier. The Top of Tyrol viewing platform crests over the mountain like a snow ridge, offering views across more than 100 lofty mountains. Join a guided walk on the glacier or head to signposted walking paths that range from family-friendly loops to more challenging hikes to high alpine lakes.</p>
<h3>Marvelous mountain huts</h3>
<p>There’s been a serious mountaineering scene in Austria since the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Over 50 mountain huts rest high in the slopes above Neustift, still offering shelter, food and drink to weary walkers. They’re great places to refuel with a bowl of cheesy ravioli-like schlutzkrapfen or a brettljause charcuterie board, and often double as mini museums, showcasing the history of mountain tourism in the Tyrol.</p>
<h3>From the mountains to Innsbruck in 30 minutes</h3>
<p>There are 850 kilometres of marked walking paths around Neustift, including valley strolls, monastery rambles, high-altitude hikes and fixed-rope via ferrata routes (not for the faint-hearted). And they’re all largely accessible thanks to the great network of gondolas and buses. A half-hour bus journey will take you to Innsbruck, the capital of the Austrian Tyrol. The old town is straight out of a Brothers Grimm tale, with a sprawling palace, grand folk art museum and the famously gleaming (if not actually golden) Golden Roof.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Neustift with Inghams?</h2>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Neustift’s best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>
<p>Plus, we've included two optional guided walks every week in Neustift. Join a professional walking guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</p>
<p>With 90 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Neustift include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>]]></description>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Neustift</h2>
<h3>Children’s activity programme</h3>
<p>Explore the outdoors, discover new things and have exciting adventures in the Stubai valley with the BIG Family Children’s Programme which welcomes children from age 4 to get out into nature and have fun. Kids aged 10+ have the option to join activities like rafting, stand-up paddling, mountain-biking, high-ropes, rock climbing and more, in a varied programme across the week. The programme (which normally runs from end Jun – end Aug) is hosted by the BIG Family, and is free to join (supplements apply for some activities) for guests in a BIG Family partner property (<a data-udi="umb://document/eea1935e3ae640229afe858ebd437d07" href="/{localLink:umb://document/eea1935e3ae640229afe858ebd437d07}" title="Hotel Der Stubaierhof">Hotel Stubaierhof</a>) – otherwise there’s a charge of approx. €25 per child, per day.</p>
<h3>Family friendly walks and playgrounds</h3>
<p>In the family-friendly valley of Stubai, bored is a thing of the past. Walk to the Klaus Äuele wild water playground to experience the force of nature as you climb, swing, zip and splash around the obstacles. Discover the animals of the forest on the wild animal theme trail or finish a walk on the Serles mountain with a splash in the Serles reservoir lakes – there’s a big play area here too if the kids still have energy to burn. The most exciting trail though, has to be the treehouse trail in Schlick where a two-hour walk takes you through a forest world of adventure with seven tree-houses to explore.</p>
<h3>Family activities</h3>
<p>Head to the adventure park in Fulpmes, which has the largest high ropes course in the Tirol region, or visit the Top of Tyrol, enjoy the views and visit the Mammoth high-altitude playground – inside the six-metre-tall mammoth is a climbing frame and playing tables – to get down, slide down its trunk. The Stubay Leisure Centre is great for families with indoor pool, waterslides and an outdoor saltwater pool and there's an airpark with trampolines and foam pit too. The Alpine rollercoaster at the Serlesbahn lift is exciting for all ages and there's a high-ropes course and zip line at the Hochseilpark new Fulpmes.</p>
<h3>Innsbruck for families</h3>
<p>The capital city of the Tyrol region has as much for the younger generation as it does for adults. The Audioversum is a science centre where you can take an interactive journey through the human senses. Or, head to Tirol Magic Land, just outside the city, where there’s the famous “upside-down-house” and Dinoland, plus playgrounds to run off excess energy.</p>]]></festivals>

  <guidedWalks><![CDATA[<h3>Inghams guided walks are included on your holiday in Neustift</h3>
<p>We’ve included two full-day walks per week in Neustift, just for Inghams guests. Join a small group and be led by a professional walking guide on some of their favourite trails. It’s a great way to get to know the area. The walks in Neustift are run by Earla OG.</p>
<p>Walks will run on Tuesdays and Thursdays and in Summer 25 they're available from 3 Jun - 11 Sep. You can add the walks onto your holiday at the time of booking, through My Booking or by giving us a call.</p>
<h3>King Serles</h3>
<p>The Serles, one of the Seven Summits of the Stubai, is always in our view on this spectaular walk. The Serles gondola from Mieders, takes a bit of the effort out of the uphill and then we follow a slightly steep path through forests and meadows towards the Waldrasterjöchl, visiting the observation tower on route and enjoying the views to the neighbouring Wipp and Inn valleys. After refreshments at the Ochsenhütte (payable locally) we return to the gondola for our descent - if you're feel adventurous you can opt to take the summer toboggan down instead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 9.5km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/Descent:</strong> 520m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, natural trails</li>
<li><strong>Useful information: </strong>There will be a stop for lunch (payable locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 10 Jun, 24 Jun, 8 Jul, 22 Jul, 5 Aug, 19 Aug and 2 Sep</p>
<h3>Panorama Trail</h3>
<p>It's all about the views on this walk - from the top of the Elfer lift, the Panorama Trail offers an insight into the rich flora and geology of the Pinnistal, a southern side valley of the Stubai Valley. Two types of rock come together here so the geology is interesting and we're likely to see chamois, maybe a whistle or two from the local marmots too. On route, enjoy lunch at the Karalm (payable locally) where the mountain views make the traditional food taste even better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 10km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/Descent:</strong> 620m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, natural trails</li>
<li><strong>Useful information: </strong>There will be a stop for lunch (payable locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 12 Jun, 26 Jun, 10 Jul, 24 Jul, 7 Aug, 21 Aug and 4 Sep</p>
<h3>Explore the Elfer Mountain</h3>
<p>Enjoy lots of local insight and spectacular views of the Stubai and Inn valleys on this tour of Neustift's home mountain, the Elfer. The gondola does the most of the uphill and we start our walk from the top of the lift, visiting the sundial and then climbing up to the Elferhütte to admire the view. A leisurely path takes us to the rustic Autenalm, one of the oldest Alpine pastures of the Tyrol, and where we enjoy lunch at the hut (payable locally). After refuelling, it's slightly uphill to the lift station to catch the gondola back down to the valley.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> easy - moderate (reasonable fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/Descent:</strong> 400m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, natural trails</li>
<li><strong>Useful information: </strong>There will be a stop for lunch (payable locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 3 Jun, 17 Jun</p>
<h3>Falbeson Nockalm - Stubai's Hidden Gem</h3>
<p>Still considered one of Stubai Valley's "insider tips" this is a beautiful walk to the newly built Falbesoner Nockalm Hut where you'll enjoy a lunch of regional delicacies (payable locally) with a wonderful mountain panorama. The route up to the hut is a steady incline through a shady forest following a narrow trail. It gains altitude quite quickly, and you're rewarded with stunning views.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 4km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 4.5hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/Descent:</strong> 450m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, natural trails</li>
<li><strong>Useful information: </strong>There will be a stop for lunch (payable locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 5 Jun, 19 Jun, 3 Jul, 17 Jul, 31 Jul, 14 Aug, 28 Aug and 11 Sep</p>
<h3>Stubai Glacier and the Top of Tyrol</h3>
<p>This walk is all about the glacier - and beautiful views of course. You'll visit the Top of Tyrol viewing platform for the most spectacular views of the surrounding mountains - you can see as far as Italy in one direction, and Germany in the other. Learn some interesting facts about the ice and life at altitude, before walking down to the mid-station and return to the valley by gondola.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate (basic fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 3km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> approx. 2hrs</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/Descent:</strong> 400m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> dirt tracks, natural trails</li>
<li><strong>Useful information: </strong>There will be a stop for lunch (payable locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: 1 Jul, 15 Jul, 29 Jul, 12 Aug, 26 Aug and 9 Sep</p>
<p><strong>For every walk you will need: </strong>suitable walking shoes/boots with good grip, appropriate walking clothing, sun cream, insect repellent, sunglasses, rain jacket, a warmer layer, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a snack, cash for mountain huts and your Stubai Super Card. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<p><em>Early booking is strongly recommended as spaces are limited. All walks are subject to availability of local guides, weather conditions and maximum numbers. Planned routes are subject to change. Any distances and ascents/descents stated are approximate. Full details of the walks with the meeting points and routes will be provided to you on arrival. In some instances there may be a small charge for local transport that is payable locally. In resorts where the walks run over more than two days, the day of the walk will be allocated to you by your Rep in your welcome meeting. Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavour to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking. The decision of the guide on the suitability of the walk for you is final and no compensation will be paid where the guide believes, in their professional opinion, that it is not suitable. Please ensure you are well-equipped for the walk have suitable clothing and footwear. Walks are not recommended for guests under 12 years. Any guests under 18 years will need to be accompanied by an adult.</em></p>]]></guidedWalks>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Wild Water Trail Stage 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Expect to take around an hour-and-a-half each way</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the banks of the Ruetz River to the widest waterfall in the Eastern Alps. During this walk you will pass mainly through the wooded part of the valley - home to lots of wildlife and plant species. This walk will take you via Ruetz Katarak which is a beautiful flow of water, and Tschangelair Alm for a bite to eat as well. With non-stop stunning views that will surround you, you wont even notice the gentle 200 metre incline.</p>
<h3>Wild Water Trail Stage 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Expect to take around two-and-a-half hours each way</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the most beautiful walks in the valley. Expect some uneven ground as you will walk along the trail through the woods, followed by an open plateau later on. An alternative route (challenging) takes you ascending on the Grawa Waterfall side. If you add an extra half hour you can reach the Blaue Lake, a crystal-clear alpine lake above Sulzenau Huette. Covering an altitude of 670 metres, your legs will definitely be put to the test on this stage of the Wild Water Trail.</p>
<h3>Pinnis Valley Split Stone</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Expect to take around three hours</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching the top station of the Elferbahn by cable car an approx. 1 hour walk takes you to the Pinnisalm. North of Pinnisalm there is the nature site of Pinnis Valley/Split stone, a giant split rock formation dating from the Mezozoic era. Make sure to have your laces tied as you may pick up the pace on the descent.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Neustift is a springboard to the supersized sights of the Stubai Valley, including the impressive Stubai Glacier]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Neustift</h2>
<p>With a vast amount of both high and low level walking available, as well as numerous other activities, holidays in Neustift and the Stubai Valley have something for everyone. In addition, regular transport to Innsbruck offers the chance of sightseeing and shopping in the Tyrol's historic capital. Neustift is a lively village in high season with regular brass band concerts and Tyrolean evenings, and Mieders, approximately three kilometres away, enjoys a tranquil setting and is popular for its direct access to walking routes.</p>
<h3>Experience Neustift</h3>
<p>Neustift has a lovely atmosphere in the summer, with a variety of musical entertainment in the evenings. There’s traditional concerts performed by a Tyrolean band in the village square, brass band concerts at the outdoor music pavilion and classical or jazz concerts in the local Parish Church, so plenty to make your evenings interesting. The weekly Farmer’s Market is stocked with local produce and worth a visit too.</p>
<h3>Top of Tyrol and Stubai Glacier</h3>
<p>At an altitude of 3,210 metres, the Top of Tyrol summit platform is a must-visit for the views – you can see across the Stubai Alps and even as far as the Dolomites on a clear day. The view is just as great from the Schaufeljoch chapel which looks over the Stubai Glacier from its position on the mountain ridge. Explore high-altitude hiking routes, walk to a hut for a delicious lunch or hike around the idyllic Mutterbergersee lake.</p>
<h3>Mountain biking in the Stubai Valley</h3>
<p>The Stubai Valley has a lot to offer bikers, with around 240 kilometres of trails weaving through the area, and it’s not just routes for extreme mountain bikers, either. There’s plenty of trails to suit pleasure cyclists and families, so hop on a bike and explore on two wheels. Many of the mountain huts are accessible by bike, and there’s several rental places – rent an e-bike to make the uphill a bit easier.</p>
<h3>Stubai swimming, sauna and sports</h3>
<p>Whether you want to raft on the river, pound the trails running, do some yoga on a mountain-top or even explore by segway, you can do it in the Stubai valley. For swimming, the Stubay leisure centre has indoor pools and slides, plus a spacious outdoor area, great for warm weather and if you need a bit of rest and relaxation, the sauna area is the place to go.</p>
<p>Your Stubai Supercard (see "Cards &amp; passes" tab for further information) gets you one free three-hour admission to the Stubay leisure centre pools, as well as use of the outdoor swimming pool in Mieders, which is a historical pool that was built in 1927. It’s been lovingly restored in full respect of its tradition and also has a dedicated family area.</p>
<p>Look up in Neustift and you’re bound to see paragliders high up in the sky. It’s one of the most popular areas in Austria for paragliding and there are several paragliding schools offering tandem flights if you fancy ticking this thrilling activity off your list.</p>
<h3>Visit Innsbruck</h3>
<p>Innsbruck is the capital of the Tyrol region, and is well worth a visit – especially as your transport there is free thanks to the Stubai Supercard. Visit the medieval old town - famous for the Golden Roof - or the Ambras Castle, which was the first museum in the world and opened over 450 years ago. The best views of the city can be seen from the top of Nordkette, 1,700 metres above the city, accessed by the architecturally renowned Hungerbergbahn and then the Hafelekar cable car, or take a trip to the top of the Olympic ski jump on the south side of the city.</p>
<p>For art and culture lovers, the Hofkirche offers an unexpected mix between church and medieval art museum, and is home to the cenotaph of the Emperor Maximillian the First. Just outside the city, in Wattens, Swarovski Crystal World is a must-see for lovers of sparkles, with interesting exhibits, beautiful gardens and play zones for children.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, a rucksack and walking poles are useful for hiking around Neustift and the surrounding area. There's pseveral places in Neustift to buy walking equipment<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.kirchmair-seefeld.at/sporthaus/verleih.html" target="_blank"></a>. Or, if you stay at the Alpenhotel Tirolerhof you can borrow walking poles free of charge directly from the hotel.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 418 for Neustift and the Stubai valley, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the hiking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
