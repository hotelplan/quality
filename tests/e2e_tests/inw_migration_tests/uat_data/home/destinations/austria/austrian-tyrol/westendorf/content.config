  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk through lush meadows and forests to picturesque mountain peaks</li>
<li>Stroll through the pretty, traditional village centre</li>
<li>Enjoy a classic brass band concert at the bandstand</li>
</ul>
<p>On a sunny plateau in the Brixen Valley, Westendorf is surrounded by patchwork fields, forests, rolling hills and mountain peaks - it's the ideal spot for a summer holiday. Buses, trains, gondolas and a network of walking and cycling paths link it to popular villages such as <a data-udi="umb://document/085c5cbb87794e7c9ca8a69475a257df" href="/{localLink:umb://document/085c5cbb87794e7c9ca8a69475a257df}" title="Soll">Söll</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/770717fcbb524fc8b57e0feef58fcce0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/770717fcbb524fc8b57e0feef58fcce0}" title="Ellmau">Ellmau</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/0424394c50b54ef4848722ee185d0739" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0424394c50b54ef4848722ee185d0739}" title="Kitzbuhel">Kitzbühel</a>. The Austrian Hiking Seal of Quality glimmers on many a trail too, so expect superbly signposted and maintained routes. On bright days, the village basks in full sunshine – ideal for kicking back with a schnapps on a mountain-view terrace.</p>
<h2>Walking in Westendorf and the Brixen Valley</h2>
<p>This patch of the Alps offers every flavour of footpath. The Westendorf Wellbeing Trail ambles by dappled forest glades and rivers. For a longer stroll, walk over wooden bridges and past waterfalls to neighbouring Hopfgarten – a market town and gateway to Hohe Salve’s mountain trails. The Windau Valley carves its way south from Westendorf, steering cyclists and hikers to green riverside paths, while more challenging routes scale the local mountain of Nachtsöllberg via pretty alpine mountain huts. Fancy saving your energy? The Alpenrosen cable car takes out much of the leg work in reaching the Nachtsöllberg summit, and the Brixen lift rises from Brixen village into the Bergwelt, where trails lead in all directions.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Westendorf</h3>
<p>Both villagers and visitors wholeheartedly embrace summer in Westendorf, taking to the café terraces with plates of schnitzel, alpine ales and herby lemonades. In fact, the whole town seems to burst into flower, with streets that once won gold as Europe’s most beautiful village in bloom. Even the St. Nicholas church is painted a cheery buttercup-yellow; the dome has watched over the village for centuries. Don’t miss the weekly market, where local craftspeople set out stalls piled high with hand-knitted gloves, truffle cheeses, wooden bird houses and bottles of berry schnapps.</p>
<h3>Alpine adventures for families</h3>
<p>Family activities in Westendorf come with a side of mountain views. The swimming pool is open-air, enclosed in gardens and views of the Kitzbühel Alps. Meanwhile, the Alpenrosen cable car takes families to the Alpinolino playground, where kids can put on their detective hats while learning about the animals and wildflowers of the Alps. Catch the gondola from neighbouring Brixen for the Filzalm Lake – a sky-high picnic spot with play areas and wildlife hides.</p>
<h3>From the mountains to Munich</h3>
<p>Trains depart like clockwork from Westendorf station, about a 10-minute walk away from the village centre. The swish summer resort of Kitzbühel is only a 15-minute trundle along the valley and you can also swap the mountains for Munich in just one hour. This Bavarian city might be best known for Oktoberfest, but there’s also an old town with a turreted city hall straight out of a Brothers Grimm tale.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Westendorf with Inghams?</h2>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Summer holidays in Westendorf are perfect for mountain lovers - with over 800 kilometres of picturesque walking trails to explore]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Westendorf</h2>
<h3>Over 250km of walking paths</h3>
<p>Gentle paths and green grassy slopes surround the village of Westendorf. Put your walking boots on and ease yourself into the mountain scenery and even-terrain with pretty valley walks before venturing further into the Kitzbüheler Alps, where even more trails and marked routes lead to summit crosses and picturesque mountain lakes. Whether you're a leisurely stroller or keen peak-bagger - there's trails to suit every kind of walker in Westendorf.</p>
<h3>Cycling in Westendorf</h3>
<p>Take your mountain bike up in one of the cable cars after planning your very own bike tour with the online interactive map. Maybe you prefer something more leisurely? Then a ride to Kitzbühel is just right for you; a lovely one-hour bike ride via Lake Schwarzsee. E-Bikes are available to rent locally too if you want a little assistance on the uphill.</p>
<h3>Cafés and shops</h3>
<p>Stroll through the village at your own pace and browse the shops and handcrafted souvenirs. Spend an afternoon indulging in some traditional food, or taking in the fresh mountain air in on a café terrace surrounded by flower baskets and timeless wooden buildings - a perfect finish to a morning of walking.</p>
<h3>Exploring the area</h3>
<p>Being part of the Kitzbüheler Alps, Westendorf has many places to go and activities to do nearby. You can visit the Schnapps distillery in St. Johann, local cheesemaking farms and even a 100-year-old farmhouse. The superb network of public transport, chairlifts and gondolas all make your time in the region a whole lot easier - it's easy to head a little further afield on the train too so why not enjoy a day out in Munich.</p>
<h3>Top-location Golfing</h3>
<p>Golf course Westendorf is the youngest course in the region, covering a total distance of 5,882 metres. This easily walkable course has 18 holes over 64 hectares of well-groomed alpine landscape. Featuring unforgettable views and amazing facilities, you can enjoy a full course game, or just visit the driving range for a quick practise. Did you know you can find an original red British phone booth in the middle of the course?</p>
<h3>Festivals and events</h3>
<p>Westendorf has lots of brilliant events and a weekly programme that means a holiday in the Kitzbüheler Alps is something quite special indeed. Make the most of the opportunity to enjoy local traditions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weekly brass band concerts from June</li>
<li>Weekly market in July</li>
<li>Weekly Tyrolean evenings (High season)</li>
<li>Regular live music at hotels</li>
<li>Annual Dorf Fest Village festival/carnival (August)</li>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Westendorf and the wider area. There are several places in Westendorf to buy walking equipment or the <a data-udi="umb://document/1742a725e72347d8b879e6199785d8d3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/1742a725e72347d8b879e6199785d8d3}" title="Vitalhotel Schermer">Vitalhotel Schermer</a> offers guests staying there rucksacks and umbrellas to borrow.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 456 for the Westendorf and the Brixental, which have a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Westendorf</h3>
<p>In Westendorf alone, there are over 200 kilometres of perfectly tended and signposted hiking trails to explore with around 800 kilometres in the wider region which is easily accessible thanks to the fantastic bus, train and lift network. Walk across lush pastures and gentle grass mountains to rustic alpine huts where the traditional culinary delights await - ideal for the gourmet hiker! The views are spectacular at every turn, and some of area's trails have earned the Austrian Hiking Seal of Quality which recognises outstanding walking.</p>
<p>The Hiking and Stamp Book serve as an inspiration and motivation to go hiking in the mountains and you can collect points at most summits and at many of the mountain huts along the routes. Earn enough points and you can collect hiking pins from the Tourist Office.</p>
<h3>Guided Walks</h3>
<p>Westendorf Tourist Office offers a varied programme of guided walks (some supplements apply) for all abilities, enabling you to discover some of Westendorf's most scenic spots with a guide, learning fascinating information about the area along the way (book directly with the tourist office).</p>
<p>There is also the option to join two Inghams guided walks per week from Kitzbühel - see the tab below for further details.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
