  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Take the gondolas up to Valluga for the most impressive views</li>
<li>Indulge in some selfcare at the spa</li>
<li>Walk through the Rosanna gorge and picturesque Verwall valley</li>
</ul>
<p>Summer holidays in St. Anton are best spent getting out into the mountains of the Arlberg – which is easy, thanks to the cable cars, trusty village buses and innumerable walking and biking trails. The train station also brings Innsbruck and Zurich within easy (and very scenic) day-tripping reach. Back in town, look out for yoga festivals and outdoor film screenings with an even more cinematic backdrop, or enjoy a relaxed atmosphere with aperitif alfresco. Also, the dining is divine - take your pick from mountain recipes served with Alpine views, candle-lit wine bars and steakhouses chasing their first Michelin stars.</p>
<h2>Walking in the Arlberg</h2>
<p>There are around 270 kilometres of marked footpaths around St. Anton that vary from forested valley trails to ridge walks with panoramic views of peaks and glaciers. The Verwall Alps are on the doorstep. Here, mountains soar up over 3,000 metres and mountain huts are connected by sky-high trails. The emerald waters of Verwall Lake are a short bus ride from St. Anton – great for families looking for a beautiful walk with a playground and café finale. Don’t miss the suspension bridge, which hangs above the rushing waters of the Rosanna River.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in St. Anton</h3>
<p>St. Anton’s streets snake along the foot of the Arlberg massif. Take the time to wander the pedestrianised village centre and browse the Ski and Local Heritage Museum. Outside, it looks like a real-life gingerbread house; inside, it reveals how the town became a star of the ski scene. St. Anton’s summer diary is filled with festivals and events, including a weekly Tyrolean night that revives old mountain traditions like yodelling and folk dancing. Keep an ear out for the brass bands, too. Alphorns are the instrument of choice in St. Anton and players don’t need much of an excuse to strike up a Tyrolean tune.</p>
<h3>Wellness and wonder trails</h3>
<p>Arlberg WellCom was built as a super smart media centre for the Alpine Ski World Championships. Now, it’s living a second life as an equally sleek wellness centre with swimming pools, waterslides, saunas, a gym and tennis courts. And all with widescreen mountain views.</p>
<p>Families can also visit the Senn family’s Sennhütte – a mountain hut with a Wonder Trail of sensory herb gardens, tree houses and a record-breaking edelweiss flowerbed. You read that right – it won the Guinness World Record for the biggest flower arrangement on the planet.</p>
<h3>Journey to Switzerland by train</h3>
<p>The construction of the railway and nearby Arlberg Pass changed St. Anton’s course forever, transforming it from a sleepy village to a ski resort that would become the place to be for downhill skiing. These days, the train station is a one-stop shop for day trips to the Tyrolean capital of Innsbruck and Switzerland’s Zurich, with its bright turquoise lake. If city explorations aren’t your thing, there are plenty of tiny village stations to disembark at en route.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in St. Anton</h2>
<h3>Arl.park Sports Centre</h3>
<p>You can enjoy a game of family bowling, squash, table tennis or pickleball. This indoor leusire centre also features a full-sized tennis court, ideal for those seeking a competition. Children especially love the indoor trampoline park and interactive climbing wall. Who will be the first to make it to the top?</p>
<h3>Nature trails</h3>
<p>Let the kids explore the natural beauty through short trails and amusing stations. At only one kilometre long the WonderWalkingWay trail next to Sennhütte is a fun way to bring nature to life. You can also complete the longer five-kilometre circular hiking trail, Mutspuren, on the Galzig for a great way to learn, play and discover the courageous tracks.</p>
<h3>Discover new skills</h3>
<p>Get involved with the locals through the Tourist Office's excellent programme. Children can learn how to read maps, build rafts and observe wild animals in their natural habitat with the resort mascot "Hoppl the Hare". Running from Monday to Friday with dedicated themed days, which new skill will you learn? (direct booking with the Tourist Office is required).</p>
<h3>Pushchair-friendly walks</h3>
<p>St. Anton am Arlberg has a 40-kilometre network of cross-country wide paths perfect for families taking a pushchair. With easy walking and steady ground, parents can enjoy a leisurely stroll completely stress-free. We love the Verwall Valley walk, stretching 10-kilometres past beautiful scenery and around the local lake.</p>
<h3>Children's playgrounds</h3>
<p>From smaller parks located in the village centre to larger high-altitude playgrounds with panoramic mountain views, you will not have a problem finding a fun-stop for the kids. They can slide their way down from the top of the climbing frame, bounce on the trampolines or spin and swing until their hearts content on the larger equipment.</p>]]></festivals>

Walk the ridge for spectacular views (keep a look out for mountain ibex), and then walk or take the cable-car back down to the middle station, stopping for lunch at the Ulmer Hutte (Jul &amp; Aug). Here you join the final section of the famous ‘Eagles Way’ route and follow trails through grazing pastures through the ‘Steissbachtal’ back down to the village.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in St. Anton</h2>
<h3>Explore the village</h3>
<p>Stroll through the traditional village, browse the shops and take in the postcard-perfect views of St. Anton. This pretty town is home to world-class facilities with a slightly modern charm. Alpine cosiness combined with Tyrolean originality makes St. Anton the perfect place to relax in one of its many cafés, wander the streets and discover the history of skiing and local life in the St. Anton Museum.</p>
<h3>Walking trails and views for miles</h3>
<p>Flower walks that show you alpine roses, themed trails to take you down religious paths, and the long-distance Eagle Trail are all part of the extensive network of walking routes in the region. St. Anton is also a popular spot for Nordic walking with marked trails and pole rental available.</p>
<p>You don't have to walk far to get the best vantage point - take the Vallugabahn lift to reach the highest peak in St. Anton at 2,811 metres above sea level - the views over peaks and glaciers are spectacular.</p>
<h3>Mountain biking and e-biking</h3>
<p>With around 200 kilometres of bike trails, the Arlberg is an exciting place to explore on two wheels. Not a fan of the uphill? Rent an e-bike, allowing you to ride up hills much easier, cover longer distances and explore more of the area. Ride your way to breath-taking viewpoints and see nature in all its glory.</p>
<h3>Village spa</h3>
<p>Spend a day relaxing at the Arlberg WellCom. In the heart of the village you can chill in saunas &amp; steam rooms, swim indoors and outdoors, have a relaxing massage or just sit back and chill in the calming environment. If your form of relaxation is doing a workout, then head to the gym to release some endorphins for that feel-good moment before the spa.</p>
<h3>Tennis and squash</h3>
<p>Take a trip to Arl.park centre and challenge each other to a game of tennis, squash or even bowling. If the weather isn't being kind, then a trip the sports centre has you covered so you can still enjoy your favourite sports.</p>
<h3>Indoor climbing centre and lessons</h3>
<p>Arl.rock sport-park and restro-bar is a climber's paradise. Offering a large 1,000 square-metre climbing area with an indoor bouldering wall, there is something on offer for all abilities. With around 100 climbing routes, it's not just indoors you will find yourself holding on up high. Will you take on the 18-metre outside tower?</p>
<h3>9-hole golf course</h3>
<p>Are you a passionate golfer? St. Anton am Arlberg has a stunning nine-hole golf course. Tee off the right way with incredible views, freshly cut grass and a supportive local community. Use your included summer card for one free entry during your holiday (golf license required).</p>
<h3>Evening Entertainment and Culture</h3>
<p>Spend your evenings indulging in the local culture. There is plenty of evening entertainment including Tyrolean evenings with yodelling, cow bells and dancing. You can also experience the weekly brass band concerts and maybe catch a procession. We love the relaxed atmosphere the local community create in the village centre in summertime.</p>
<h3>St. Anton Village Festival</h3>
<p>Normally around the mid July, the Village Festival is a wonderful celebration of culture and heritage with dance, Tyrolean music, local arts and crafts and traditional food.</p>
<h3>Brass Band Festival</h3>
<p>An important festival for St. Anton, the Brass Band Festival is a highlight of the summer with a parade of the local brass bands and lots of music and celebrations held in a large marquee near the new middle school in the village. It's normally held around 4th-6th August.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map number 401, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>
