  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Watch the impressive fountain show from Elisabeth Park</li>
<li>Explore by boat with a leisurely cruise on Lake Zell</li>
<li>Walk a section of the Hohe Tauern Panorama Tral from the Schmittenhöhe mountain down to town</li>
</ul>
<p>Zell am See lies on the western shore of Lake Zell – a bright blue lake squeezed between the grassy hills of the Pinzgau and the foothills of the rugged Hohe Tauern National Park - the most picturesque spot for a summer holiday in Austria. The Grossglockner (the highest peak in the country) is within easy reach and there are around 400 kilometres of marked walking paths locally - accessed by bus, train and mountain lifts - with routes ranging from pushchair-friendly promenades to day hikes on panoramic walking trails.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/dc9a6724bb5547c39e2e97ee133a7bfe" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dc9a6724bb5547c39e2e97ee133a7bfe}" title="Zell am See" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Zell am See walking deals</strong></a></p>
<h2>Walking in Zell am See</h2>
<p>A walking holiday in Zell am See will have you falling in love with the outdoors. Catch a gondola from Zell am See to Schmittenhöhe (1,965 metres) - the local mountain - for a bird’s eye view over the lake, town and a sweep of 3,000 metre-plus peaks. The Sissi Loop is an easy walk, following a route trodden by the 19<sup>th </sup>Century Empress Elisabeth “Sissi” of Austria. Make sure to peek in the wooden chapel dedicated to another Elisabeth – this time, the holy Princess of Thüringen.</p>
<p>The final stage of the 275 kilometre long-distance Hohe Tauern Panorama Walking Trail heads from the Schmittenhöhe back down to Zell am See – or you can follow part of it in the opposite direction, towards more challenging mountain trails.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Zell am See: life by the See</h3>
<p>Zell am See is a beloved escape for the rich and royal – but the town lived many lives before becoming a luxury retreat. This lakeshore has hosted Roman settlements, a monastery of monks and a fortified market town over the years, before summer holidays in Zell am See became a favourite with the aristocracy in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Wander the medieval old town, a traffic-free zone with pavement cafés serving Austrian favourites like cheesy Pinzgauer kasnock’n dumplings. Pull up a pew in the towering Romanesque Church of St. Hippolyte which has gothic vaults and a baroque interior.</p>
<p>In summer, life in Zell am See revolves around the lake - the esplanade is the launch pad for boat cruises crossing the glassy waters. Explore by rowing boat, wakeboard, paddleboard or boat cruise. A glass-roofed ferry also crosses the lake, gliding between the tiny towns, footpaths, lidos and parks along the lake’s edge. Alternatively, the walk around the lake is an easy 11-kilometre stroll along a promenade with mountain views all the way.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Zell am See</h3>
<p>From cycling and pedalos to lakeside lidos – there’s loads of things to do for families in Zell am See. Hop in the gondola up to Schmittenhöhe for a dragon-themed playground, mystical forest adventure trail and more. The fountains of Elisabeth Park perform their water dance almost hourly throughout the day, and three evenings a week, they light up for a night show to music. </p>
<p>Over on the Maiskogel mountain in nearby Kaprun, the mountain coaster is an exhilarating way to get down the hillside, and there are play areas and a slide park too.</p>
<h3>Discover the Pinzgau region</h3>
<p>The Alpine town of Kaprun is only a short bus ride south and here, cable cars connect adventurers to Kitzsteinhorn, where Salzburgerland's highest viewing platform, the "Top of Salzburg" reveals the summits of Hohe Tauern National Park. The Sigmund Thun Gorge is worth a visit too, with wooden walkways that traverse the dramatic rock walls above rushing waters.</p>
<p>Zell am See's railway station cemented the town as a sought-after summer spot and trains connect day-trippers to Krimml Waterfalls - the staggering falls drop a total of 380 metres over three stages. Cities like Kitzbühel are within easy train reach too, and excursions to Salzburg, Grossglockner and Berchtesgaden (famous for the Eagle's Nest) are also available.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Zell Am See</h2>
<h3>Playgrounds</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">There's a few parks dotted around Zell Am See - the highlight is bound to be on the family mountain Schmittenhöhe, home to Schmidolin, a spectacular dragon and his fire themed playground. Here children can swing, slide, crawl, climb and release all their built-up energy. For parents, there are also reclining benches for you to rest while the kids are playing.</span></p>
<h3>Themed trails</h3>
<p>There's a world of daring adventures on the Schmittenhöhe mountain. Schmidolin’s baptism of fire trail includes an adventure workbook to keep the children amused while they solve tricky tasks and pass tests of courage along the way. Complete the booklet for a surprise at the end.</p>
<h3>Schmidolin’s Hot Wheels</h3>
<p>Take the children to top of the areitXpress where Schmidolin has created a real-life hot-wheels adventure; for ages six and above. Ride the electric bikes around the circuit after gearing up with safety helmets, knee pads and themed clothing. Children do not have to have any previous experience as complete beginners will have on-site instructions provided.</p>
<h3>Cool Kids Fun Programme</h3>
<p>On selected dates during the summer season children aged five to fifteen can take part in the Tourist Office's children's programme. Activities can include gemstone searches, castle visits, cinema trips, baking classes and climbing towers. On some dates parents can even get involved, too (direct booking via the Tourist Office is required for children and parents).</p>
<h3>Zell Am See Lidos</h3>
<p>The three lidos on Lake Zell are hotspots for water babies. The closest lido is on the lake front in Zell am See, and the others are in Thumersbach and Schüttdorf - great for breaking up a lake-side walk. Grab a paddleboard and float on the calm lake waters, or zip down the slide into the pool. You can also enjoy the sectioned off toddler pool at the lido, great for the little ones to have some fun too. </p>
<h3>Water activities on the lake</h3>
<p>The lake isn't just for swimming. You can take the kids on a rented kayak, stand-up paddle boards, water trampolines and so much more. One of our favourite family water adventures is hiring a pedalo. Children love the little slide off the back and there's a chance to spot the fish too.</p>]]></festivals>

<h3>Water based activities</h3>
<p>Rent a boat on the lake and keep dry, or how about stand-up paddle boarding for a refreshing experience to cool off. Lake Zell has a wide selection of on-water activities and rentals to keep you busy during those warm summer days. Make your way around the lake to discover new activities every day.</p>
<h3>Summer skiing or take to the skies</h3>

<h3>Gipfelwelt 3000</h3>
<p>Bordering the Hohe Tauern National Park, Gipfelwelt 3000 offers a unique view of the glaciated peaks.

<h3>Amazing cycling opportunities</h3>
<p>The cycling in the Zell am See Kaprun region is extensive. E-biking, gravel biking, freeriding and mountain biking - there's so many routes and marked trails, you’ll be spoilt for choice.

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h4>Recommended equipment</h4>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Zell am See and the surrounding area. There's plenty of places in Zell am See to buy walking equipment.</p>
<h4>Walking maps</h4>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 574 for Zell am See and the surrounding area, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the hiking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h4>Walking guidelines</h4>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:</li>
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
