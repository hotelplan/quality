  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk the impressive Treetop Trail and Golden Gate Bridge of the Alps</li>
<li>Make the most of free hiker's lifts for easy access to the best views and walks</li>
<li>Rent a bike and explore some off-road trails</li>
</ul>
<p>Saalbach Hinterglemm is a real adventure base; the ideal place for an active summer holiday. But as well as the extreme sports on offer, the 400 kilometres of trails for walking and routes for every kind of biking, it's also a beautiful place to relax. Wander through vast woodland finding hammocks for a nap (dotted along the wellness trail), or kick back at one of 40 traditional mountain huts serving local food.</p>
<h2>Walking in Saalbach Hinterglemm</h2>
<p>With so many trails carved into the mountainsides and valleys in the summer, there's a path for everyone here. Pick from family wildlife trails, wellness walks through the forests or ramble from hut to hut.</p>
<p>Part adventure, part scavenger hunt, part puzzle, the ‘smugglers escape trail’ is an immersive family game that follows the story of a smuggler along a five kilometre path in the Glemmtal mountains, that’s bound to tire out the team. Similar, but for the younger kids, Montelino’s Adventure Path treasure hunt is a great family walk.</p>
<h3>Free use of the lifts</h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.saalbach.com/en/summer/joker-card" target="_blank">Joker Card</a> is included at all of our hotels and offers incredible value with free or discounted access to many summer activities. Enjoy unlimited use of up to six hiker's lifts in Saalbach Hinterglemm (opening dates vary throughout the summer) for easy access to walking routes and great views, free entry to lots of attractions around the area, free public transport throughout the local area, and much more.</p>
<h3>Family summer holidays in Saalbach Hinterglemm</h3>
<p>Saalbach Hinterglemm is the perfect summer holiday destination for adventure-loving families with a seemingly endless list of activities to try out. The High Rope Park is the largest in Europe at over eight kilometres in length. There’s 200 different stations and 30 rope slides connecting platforms ranging from three to 40 metres high – it’s not for the faint hearted (or unenergetic!).</p>
<p>Slightly lower in intensity and closer to the ground, is the ‘motor skills path’ which follows the Saalach River between Jausern and Saalbach, with 24 stations to test and improve agility, balance and fitness.</p>
<p>Freestylers should head to the Jump and Slide Park where there’s an eight metre jumping tower (onto an airbag), a trampoline area and kicker.</p>
<h3>Explore the Pinzgau region</h3>
<p>The wooden walkway through the Sigmund-Thun Klamm is a spectacular journey through a deep rocky gorge and past impressive waterfalls. It's the other side of Zell am See, and makes a great day-trip using public transport to explore the bigger region, particularly on a hot summer day if you're looking to cool off. The Wasserfallboden and Mooserboden Reservoirs, and the Krimml Waterfalls should also be added to the list, along with excursions to bucket-list destinations such as <a data-udi="umb://document/31b86014d3b04c3da584cc56dca63c66" href="/{localLink:umb://document/31b86014d3b04c3da584cc56dca63c66}" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> – the city of the Sound of Music – or Grossglockner – Austria’s highest mountain.</p>
<h3>Austria's biggest bike region</h3>
<p>In the summer, Saalbach Hinterglemm transforms into <a data-udi="umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760}" title="Austria">Austria’s</a> number one bike destination (which is saying something in this serious biking nation) with nine lifts on seven different mountains, and hundreds of kilometres of trails for every kind of biker. If you haven’t been cycling ‘off-road’ before, why not give gravel biking a go and head off the tarmac into beautiful alpine landscape, perhaps on the Glemmtal cycleway that connects Saalbach Hinterglemm to the town of Maishofen. </p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The walking around Saalbach Hinterglemm is so good that many of the routes could be classed as favourites, but here are just a few routes that we really love:</p>
<h3>Alpine Herb Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very easy walk</li>
<li>1.8km with 92m height gain</li>
<li>The walk takes around forty minutes but it's easy to extend if you wish</li>
</ul>
<p>A great walk for nature lovers, this route starts at the top of the Reiterkogel lift. Learn about over 200 different herbs and alpine flowers from the area and enjoy the views.</p>
<h3>Kohlmais Panorama</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>9.9km with 164m height gain</li>
<li>The walk takes around three and a half hours (plus stops for delicious food and lots of photos)</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk offers stunning views of the surrounding area. You begin at the top station of the Kohlmais lift and take a shady forest path to the Schönleitenhütte, where you can stop for lunch on the sunny terrace. Afterwards, descend on the Güterweg to the Hochwartweg and catch the Kohlmais lift back down from the middle station.</p>
<h3>Forest Wellness Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relaxing, easy walk</li>
<li>Spend as long as you like</li>
</ul>
<p>Science tells us that the outdoors have a positive effect on our well-being. On the forest wellness trail at the Reiterkogel in Hinterglemm, you can fill your lungs with fresh air and relax in the woodland. The forest here is over 200 years old and contains over 1,000 spruce trees. There are places for yoga, a forest library, picnic areas and hammocks and sun loungers to relax in. A circuit of the trail takes around 20 minutes to walk round, but you can stay as long as you wish.</p>
<h3>Saalbach Hiking Challenge</h3>
<p>Earn yourself a trophy by completing the three long distance walks of the Saalbach Hiking Challenge. Each are special in their own right, but together they become the ultimate bucket-list item for experienced hikers with good fitness:</p>
<h3>Pinzgauer Spaziergang</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>18km with 650m height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take six to eight hours</li>
<li>No mountain huts on route so pack a good picnic and plenty of snacks and water</li>
</ul>
<p>From Schattberg to the Schmittenhöhe above Zell am See, this hike is a beautiful journey with panoramic views the entire way. Begin with the Schattberg X-Press (ideally get the early-morning lift around 7.30am, only possible on weekdays) and then follow the route via the Marxtensharte, Seetörl, Klinglertörl, Klammscharte and Rohrertörl to the Schmittenhöhe. Then you catch the Schmittenhöhe lift down into Zell am See and Postbus 680 back to Saalbach and Hinterglemm. </p>
<h3>Seven Summits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very challenging hike</li>
<li>24km with 1,450m of height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take nine to ten hours</li>
<li>Sturdy hiking boots (not trainers) and plenty of food and drink are essential</li>
<li>This hike requires excellent fitness and sure-footedness</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare well for this challenging and rewarding hike which takes on the seven summits of Saalbach. The route takes you from the top of the Schattberg X-Press lift (early lift around 7.30am on weekdays) and covers the Stemmerkogel, Hochkogel, Hochsaalbachkogel, Bärenstiegkogel, Manlitzkogel, Mittagskogel and finally the highest mountain of the Glemmtal, the Geißstein which stands at 2,363m. The descent via the Birgel is difficult and will also require energy. </p>
<h3>Home of Lässig Walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very challenging hike</li>
<li>22km with 1,700m height gain </li>
<li>Expect to take eight to ten hours</li>
<li>Sturdy hiking boots (not trainers) and plenty of food and drink are essential</li>
<li>This hike requires excellent fitness, sure-footedness and good preparation</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll get spectacular views every step of the way on this panoramic walk. In German, lässig means cool, and this rewarding challenge is definitely that. Be sure to keep a look out for chamois and marmots, and if you're lucky you may even catch a glimpse of a golden eagle. You'll also get to take in five summits from the Schusterscharte ridge to the Mittagskogel on to the Teufelssprung, Gamshag, Tristkogel, Saalkogel and finally the Staffkogel. There'll be no shortage of peace and tranquillity along this route, so you'll come back feeling like a new you!</p>
<h2>Family-friendly walks in Saalbach Hinterglemm</h2>
<p>Families will love Saalbach &amp; Hinterglemm not just for the great hotels and activities on offer, but also for the amount of great family-friendly walks that will keep young adventurers interested.</p>
<h3>The Wildlife Trail</h3>
<p>This new and exciting trail is at the end of the Glemm Valley. Wooden carved animal figures lurk in the woodland, teaching children about the wildlife they share the mountains with. Have a look through the large binoculars at the Ossmannalm to see what you can spot in real life. If you complete the wildlife quiz, you can pick up your medal at the Ossmannalm, too.</p>
<h3>Montelino's Adventure Path</h3>
<ul>
<li>Approx. 3km from the top of the Kohlmais lift to the middle station</li>
<li>Expect to take around 90 minutes</li>
<li>Huts with special offers for children on the way</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lots to explore on this route, helping Montelino the clown find his friends and toys and rediscover his smile. Pick up the game pass at the bottom of the lift before you head up, then follow the owl through the woods and meadows which have various activity stations to entertain the whole family.</p>
<h3>Kid's Hiking Challenge</h3>
<p>Collect a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.saalbach.com/en/summer/family/kids-hiking-challenge" target="_blank">kid's hiking challenge pass</a> from the Tourist Office and start collecting little stamps as you explore the themed trails. When you've got enough stamps, young adventurers should present their pass for a little reward.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Summer holidays in Saalbach Hinterglemm are all about enjoying the great outdoors, on foot, by bike or with the family]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Explore bustling villages</h3>
<p>Saalbach Hinterglemm is made up of two pretty villages - Saalbach and Hinterglemm. Explore the pretty, pedestrianised village centres with a selection of shops, cafés and restaurants. There's a friendly, energetic atmosphere in the summer that extends out into the mountains where you'll find authentic mountain huts. You can easily walk between the villages along a path that follows the Saalach River, or hop on the walker's bus (free with the Joker Card).</p>
<h3>Head out on a bike</h3>
<p>Saalbach Hinterglemm is part of Europe's best biking region - test your endurance on the Big-5 challenge, which links Saalbach Hinterglemm with Leogang across five mountains, six gondolas and 5,000 metres of descent. With over 80 kilometres of the finest downhill biking trails, plus hundreds of kilometres of mountain bike and gravel bike routes of varying difficulty, it's safe to say bike enthusiasts will be happy here. If you don't fancy straying too far off-road, there are plenty of tarmac and gravel cycle trails, and the mountain roads are great for road cyclists.</p>
<h3>Exciting summer adventure activities</h3>
<p>Head through a canyon course that offers rockpool jumping, waterfall slides, zip lining and abseiling. Test your head for heights on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.hochseilpark.at/en/high-ropes-park-saalbach/" target="_blank">Europe's largest high ropes park</a> or experience the ultimate flying experience - the Flying Fox is 120 metres high and can get to speeds of up to 80 kilometres per hour. The Golden Gate Bridge of the Alps is a huge suspension bridge and treetop walk with incredible views, and there's mini-golf and tennis courts in both villages of Saalbach Hinterglemm. You can also test your head for heights on a panoramic paraglide, or feed your need for speed on the go-kart track - there's so much to cram into a Saalbach Hinterglemm holiday that you'll need to come back again and again.</p>
<h3>Visit Sigmund-Thun-Klamm</h3>
<p>The wooden walkway through the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.klamm-kaprun.at/en/" target="_blank">Sigmund-Thun Klamm</a> is a spectacular journey through a deep rocky gorge and over impressive waterfalls. It's the other side of Zell am See so use public transport to get there. Hop on the bus from Saalbach Hinterglemm to Zell am See and then take <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.klamm-kaprun.at/en/directions/bus-map/" target="_blank">the connecting service</a> to the gorge. </p>
<p>We also recommend a day trip to the high mountain reservoirs of Wasserfallboden and Mooserboden or the Krimml Waterfalls - the highest waterfalls in Europe and fifth highest in the world.</p>
<h3>Take a day trip to Zell am See</h3>
<p>On the edge of the picturesque Lake Zell, is the bustling town of Zell am See, with pretty streets and lots of shops to explore. Watch a fountain show from Elisabeth Park, or take a boat cruise along the lake, rent a paddleboard or take the children to the lido on the edge of the water to play and swim. There's also plenty to do, and lots of beautiful walking trails, on the Schmittenhöhe mountain - the view from the top is worth the trip and the Franzl hut serves up delicious local food on the panoramic sun terrace.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

Spend the day discovering the pretty Bavarian town of Berchtesgaden itself, or choose one of the optional extras that you can add on to your day.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;\">The most famous is the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest). Explore the historic building and surrounding area, with spectacular views on a clear day over the King's Lake.

A network of tunnels and slides take you on an underground adventure discovering this once very important industry (optional add-ons are payable locally - Eagle's Nest approx. €30.80 per person, Salt Mines approx. €22.50 per person).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;\">Departs: Tuesdays</p>\n<h3>Grossglockner from £45/30 per adult/child (full day)</h3>\n<p>This spectacular journey takes you over the Grossglockner High Alpine Road, an incredible feat of engineering with stunning views. From the Franz-Josef's Höhe you'll see the Pasterze glacier and maybe catch a glimpse of 3,798-metre summit of the Grossglockner. Keep a look out for the wild marmots and Ibex too - they love the high alpine conditions. You can visit the free museums and exhibitions to learn about the National Park or enjoy a walk round the area and a tasty Austrian mountain meal.</p>\n<p>Departs: Thursdays</p>\n<h3>Salzburg from £42/26 per adult/child (full day)</h3>\n<p>Salzburg is a city full of culture, history and music.

Immerse yourself in history as you explore the medieval Old Town, discover museums and Baroque churches or visit the Salzburg Residenz Palace - the DomQuartier. There is an optional guided walking tour which is a great way to see more of the city (payable locally, approx. €12 per person).</p>\n<p>Departs: Fridays</p>\n<p><em>We act at all times as a selling agent for the suppliers.

<p>We recommend Kompass Map number 30, which has a scale of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
