  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Enjoy leisurely lakeside strolls</li>
<li>Make the most of life by the water with a rented pedalo or rowing boat</li>
<li>Toast the day with a sundowner drink and beautiful sunset across the lake</li>
</ul>
<p>The small town of Fuschl am See is on the south-eastern edge of the bright blue lake of Fuschlsee, surrounded by pine-clad mountains and perfectly placed to explore the Salzkammergut’s exceedingly great outdoors. Some of the loveliest footpaths start from the town’s doorstep, winding through pine forests and up to viewpoints, with panoramas over alpine lakes and peaks – all easily explored thanks to the barges, buses, cable car and cycling paths that traverse the landscape. </p>
<h2>Walking in Fuschl and the Salzkammergut</h2>
<p>Enjoy languid loops of the lake and paths that weave forests and pastures or head up higher to routes up the Schober Mountain. You'll not make it far without rambling past a castle, hamlet, farm or mountain hut either – or the UFO-like HQ of Red Bull. Families can follow the Gnome’s Path through Seppen Forest from the 150-year-old Ruming Mill; time it right, and you might catch a breadmaking demo too. In nearby St. Gilgen the Zwölferhorn gondola climbs up the mountain, offering fantastic views and mountain trails. The smooth roads, gravel tracks and adventurous mountain trails mean that cycling is also very popular.</p>
<h3>Motor-free Fuschlsee</h3>
<p>Dive into nature and quietness - motorboats are banned on Fuschlsee - instead, the little Fuschlerin barge glides between the wooden jetties on the lakeshore. You can plot your own route between turquoise bays too - by kayak, rowing boat or pedalo. Any place is an excellent place for a swim – especially in the Fuschleseebad lido, where you can also rent a paddleboard. </p>
<h3>The great lakes of Salzkammergut</h3>
<p>Fuschlsee is one of around 70 lakes of the Salzkammergut region, and arguably the most peaceful. Neighbouring Wolfgangsee makes a great day trip – a livelier lake where flocks of white-sailed boats breeze across the water and water sports like wakeboarding is popular. Stop at the pretty village of St. Gilgen to peruse the church-crowned market square, enjoy a lakeside stroll from St. Gilgen to Fürberg or visit the iconic town of St. Wolfgang.</p>
<h3>Salzburg</h3>
<p>Take a scenic 40-minute bus journey west, and you’ll wind up in Salzburg. The birthplace of Mozart and setting to the famous Sound of Music film, this city is a hub of music, culture and history. Palaces and art museums decorate the baroque streets, overlooked by the imposing Salzburg Fortress and the icy waters of the Salzach river run through the centre. Peruse the shops and old iron signs on the historic Getreidegasse shopping street, or wander the famous Mirabell Gardens - just make sure you're back in Fuschl in time to cheers the sunset with a glass of Austrian wine.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Fuschl am See</h2>
<h3>Fuschlseebad lido</h3>
<p>Slide your way into the lake on the flume, or paddle your feet on the lakeside beach. More of a swimming pool fan? Then the heated outdoor pool gives the same views as the lake, but in your own comfort. There is also a large sun-bathing lawn, ideal for supervising the children or enjoying a sweet treat from the café bar deli "Das See".</p>
<h3>Activities on the lake</h3>
<p>Enjoy a relaxing ride across the lake on an electric boat. Or, get involved with the manual power of a rowboat. Let the kids slide off the edge of a pedalo, going again and again – the perfect way to cool down on a hot day, or testing your balance on a stand-up paddle board is just as fun.</p>
<h3>Playgrounds and gnome trail</h3>
<p>Kids can release their energy in the public playgrounds of Fuschl am See. Let the little ones climb over the sinking shipwreck, play in the sand and bounce on the trampoline. Go on a mission to find the gnomes of the Seppenhölzel, starting at Ruming hill, past the Kneipp herb garden and further along the Ellmaustein path. Will you answer the five questions correctly to win a prize?</p>
<h3>Woodland climbing park</h3>
<p>Just over the other side of the Filbling mountain, accessible by public bus in around 45 minutes, is the ropes course and climbing walls of Faistenau. Deep in the woods you will find the 60 stations along colour-coded trails.</p>
<h3>Mini golf and driving range</h3>
<p>Test yours and the kids putting skills at the nine-hole mini-golf course opposite the Fuschlseebad. Who will get the less amount of hits? Or even better, a hole-in-one. For teens, head to the Golfclub Waldhof, where you can all practise teeing off at the driving range.</p>
<h3>Children's hikes</h3>
<p>The whole family will love hiking around Lake Fuschl. With countless trails full of fairytale creatures, stories and puzzles, children can discover the love of hiking in their own individual ways. There is always chance for adults to get involved too, so no one misses out here.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Fuschl am See has a great network of public transport that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h3>PostBus</h3>
<p>In the Fuschlseeregion you can catch the well-timed public buses, offering an easy service to reach all destinations between Salzkammergut and Salzburg City. The public transport network system also offers a purchasable leisure ticket, allowing you to take the bus directly to over 10 hiking starting points, including the other side of the mountain.</p>
<h3>Boats</h3>
<p>Motorboats aren't allowed on Fuschsee, but the little Fuschlerin barge quietly glides across the lake between the Seepromenade in Fuschl Village and the Castle Fishery on the other side of the lake. The barge normally runs four times a day (in each direction) from June - September, and twice each morning (in each direction) in May and October. Timetables are available locally.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Fuschlsee Rundweg</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>12km</li>
<li>Expect to take around three to four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a superb circular walk around Lake Fuschl, taking you through woodland paths and farmland with lovely views across the lake throughout. Although generally an easy walk, there may be some steep and uneven sections. You can even split this walk into two sections by using the Fuschlerin boat – offering views not just by the lake, but from on it as well.</p>
<h3>Fuschl to St. Gilgen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>7km</li>
<li>Expect to take around two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the gravel path along to the Ruming Mill and continue for the iconic and beautiful ‘Mozart Blick’ view over Lake Wolfgang. Beyond here are zigzag steps built into the hillside all the way down into the pretty village of St. Gilgen, where regular buses connect back to Fuschl.</p>
<h3>Fuschl to Wartenfels Castle Ruins</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to challenging walk</li>
<li>7-8km</li>
<li>Expect to take around three to four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This lovely walk takes in the old ruins of the Wartenfels Castle and impressive panoramic views over to the neighbouring Mondsee. This hiking highlight is extremely popular from Fuschl am See, so you may even discover a few different routes and diversions – coming across multiple ruins along the way.</p>
<h3>Schober Mountain</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to challenging walk</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue on from the Wartenfels Castle to climb Fuschl’s home mountain for the best possible and breath-taking views of the lake below – accompanied by a successful ascent completion picture with the summit cross. /You can choose the less steep route over the Frauenkopf, or take a challenge directly to the Schober summit.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[The perfect place for a relaxing summer holiday, the lake of Fuschlsee is one of the most peaceful in the Salzkammergut]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Fuschl am See</h2>
<h3>The Ruming Mill</h3>
<p>The renovated mill is very popular for the locals and tourists alike. See breadmaking and other insightful demonstrations, perfect for all ages. You will also pass the Kneipp water gardens by the stream, as well as the nearby herbal gardens. Why not try some tasty freshly made bakery products.</p>
<h3>Mountain biking</h3>
<p>Ride your way to the nearby lakes, Mondsee and Wolfgangsee. Or, stay put at Fuschlsee where you can explore the simple circular route or extended routes covering Feldberg or Filbling, the surrounding mountains. With lots of trails, paths, inclines, declines and scenic routes, you can go on a new journey every day.</p>
<h3>Nordic walking</h3>
<p>Take a tour of the lake by foot, as the circular walk takes around three hours to complete (not including lunch stops at a mountain hut along the way or all the photo stops you'll make on route). You will see the beautiful lake from all points of view. Or, try something harder like the Ellmaustein five-kilometre hike, where you can see the Fuschlsee from the spectacular viewpoint above.</p>
<h3>Nine-hole golf</h3>
<p>Make your way to Golfclub Waldhof, and play a round of golf in the Salzkammergut. With exceptional views of Lake Fuschl, the environment on the Waldhof Alm, just 1.5 kilometres from Fuschl am See, is stunning. With spacious greens and traditional huts surrounding the course, you are in for a morning of golfing bliss.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
<p>Pick up a racket and ball, it's time for a round of tennis. With two tennis courts in Fuschl am See, early opening times and late closing times, you can take an hour of your day to bring back some home comforts if you're a true sports player. (Racquets and balls can be hired locally for around €10 per hour).</p>
<h3>Burgruine Wartenfels castle ruins</h3>
<p>Hike your way from the Fuschl am See village centre to the castle ruins and back, just over eight kilometres in length, taking around 3.5 hours in total. Make sure you have sturdy shoes as this route can be very challenging but the views of the green fields and turquoise waters from above are breathtaking.</p>
<h3>Fuschlseebad wellness area</h3>
<p>Relax and unwind at the Fuschlseebad lido and wellness centre. Here you can release all your everyday stresses in the bio sauna that is heated to temperatures between 40° and 60° Celsius, or the Finnish sauna that's heated between 85° and 88° Celsius. There is also a steam sauna, infrared cabin and plunge pool - great for after a lake swim from its own beach.</p>
<h3>Village bandstand</h3>
<p>Every Wednesday during the summer months, around 70 locals get together to put on a traditional brass band performance. Located within the church space, you will be surrounded by great company, a fantastic way to end the day.</p>
<h3>Festivals and events</h3>
<p>There are regular festivals and concerts in Fuschl throughout the summer from May-September, like the “Kirtagsfest” folk festival at the start of June. The summer festivity of the Heimatverein brings delicious food and incredible drinks to Fuschl am See. At the start of September, you can attend the annual harvest festival.</p>
<h3>Nearby lakes and adventures</h3>
<p>Fuschl am See hotels are a good base from which to explore the lakes region. Hop on a 10-minute bus to the nearby village of St. Gilgen, just six and a half kilometres away, where you can take a boat trip on Lake Wolfgang or take the gondola which ascends the Zwölferhorn.

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Kompass Map number 018, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Fuschl am See</h3>
<p>There are wonderful walking opportunities from Fuschl with superb panoramic views across the lake from the surrounding peaks. There are a huge number of marked trails and Nordic walking paths starting directly from the village. A variety of trails around the lake are interspersed with stops at working farms, mills and alms, and there is a great sense of travel with paths to surrounding hamlets and lakes, as well as challenging hikes up the Schober Mountain behind the village.</p>
<p>Fuschl is well connected by bus to both St. Gilgen and St. Wolfgang for further walks on the Zwölferhorn and Schafberg Mountains.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
