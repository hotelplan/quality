  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Treat yourself to gourmet food in award-winning restaurants</li>
<li>Walk a section of the Lechweg trail to the beautiful Formarinsee mountain lake</li>
<li>Take a refreshing dip in Lech's forest swimming pool</li>
</ul>
<p>Lech, in the western reaches of <a data-udi="umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760}" title="Austria">Austria</a>, is awash with see-and-be-seen skiers in winter. In summer, however, it’s a place transformed. The melting snows reveal jewel-green slopes and a village filled with gourmet restaurants and boutiques – plus summer cable cars and buses that open up several hundred kilometres’ worth of hiking and cycling paths. Summer holidays in Lech dive into this pretty picture of rugged mountains, turquoise lakes, meadows and forests, while also offering plenty for families with a penchant for adventure.</p>
<h2>Walking in Lech: 350 kilometres of alpine trails</h2>
<p>Lech is a great base for exploring the mountainous Arlberg on foot and by bike. Seek out summits, and ramble wildflower meadows and woodland paths that start in the centre of Lech - stopping off at a rustic mountain hut or two along the way to treat your tastebuds and refuel with some local food. The Arlberg Trail is a long-distance path created in 2021 to connect the five Arlberg villages of Lech, <a data-udi="umb://document/7f056630899e45e8b8e0eef21334f8ef" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7f056630899e45e8b8e0eef21334f8ef}" title="St. Anton">St. Anton</a>, St. Christoph, Zürs and Stuben. The Lechweg Trail is another classic, following one of the wildest river landscapes in Europe. One section goes through Lech and close to the river’s source at Formarinsee Lake – once voted the most beautiful place in the country by Austrian TV viewers.</p>
<h3>From Walser roots to world gourmet village</h3>
<p>Boutique shops, luxury hotels, spas and chic restaurants stock the streets of Lech. It can all feel a long way from the village’s modest farming roots. With the highest per capita ratio of award-winning restaurants, there's good reason this little gem is nicknamed the gourmet village. But look a little closer, and you’ll find traditional restaurants offering hearty Austrian recipes too. The good food continues into the mountains where you can refuel with Wiener schnitzel or kaiserschmarr'n (caramelised pancakes with rum-soaked raisins) in a rustic mountain hut.</p>
<p>You can get more of a flavour of Lech’s history in the Huber House Museum, as well as the 14th-century church of St. Nicholas, where a stern grey exterior hides away a delightfully OTT rococo interior.</p>
<h3>Explore on summer lifts</h3>
<p>Walkers and cyclists can take advantage of up to six ski lifts that open for the summer. Rüfikopfbahn climbs over 2,000 metres to the plateau of Lech Zürs, the first leg of the Green Ring (that’s the summer edition of the legendary White Ring ski circuit). Meanwhile, the Bergbahn Oberlech heads to a plateau renowned for its sunny hills, turquoise lakes, mountain huts and the Skyspace art installation, where you can watch the changing sky in a Space Age bunker.</p>
<h3>Lech Forest Pool and the Green Riddle Ring</h3>
<p>Lech Forest Pool lays out lanes, loungers, waterslides, playgrounds and and an ice cream kiosk amongst green lawns and the shady pines of the forest. In summer, kids’ alpine activity clubs transform children into mini mountaineers with forest camps and wildlife walks. Elsewhere, the Green Riddle Ring follows the Green Ring – but with a bonus round of puzzles to be cracked at each stop.</p>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Kompass Map number 33, which has a scale of 1:50,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Lech</h3>
<p>A true walker's paradise, Lech's 350 kilometres of marked hiking paths range from flower-filled meadows, riverside and woodland paths starting from the village centre, to remote high alpine routes up to beautiful lakes and rugged peaks. There are plenty of rustic mountain alms, as well as designated picnic areas, and a great sense of travel as paths link through local hamlets and over into different valleys.</p>
<h3>Guided Walks</h3>
<p>Guided walks are offered through the Lech Summer Card, including themed herbal and history walks and a twilight hike. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/lakes-mountains-holidays/hotels/item91731/austria/" target="_blank">Hotel Austria</a> also offers free guided walks with their own walking guides - subject to change at short notice.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
