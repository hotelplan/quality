  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Enjoy leisurely lakeside strolls and refreshing swims</li>
<li>Head up the Rofan or Karwendel cable-cars for impressive views</li>
<li>Take a relaxing cruise on Tyrol's largest lake</li>
</ul>
<p>Beautifully situated on the scenic western shores of <a data-udi="umb://document/5974cd987d3f4f66b37fbebc74ee7ebb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/5974cd987d3f4f66b37fbebc74ee7ebb}" title="Lake Achensee">Lake Achensee</a>, the largest and deepest lake in the Tyrol, Pertisau is known for its striking emerald waters, framed by the picturesque Karwendel and majestic Rofan mountain ranges. Popular day time activities include boat trips across the lake or exploring the lakeshore villages by bike or the famous Achensee steam railway. As well as easy promenade strolls around the lake, there is also extensive hiking above the village and an abundance of wildlife in what is Tyrol's largest nature reserve. </p>
<h3>Valleys and villages</h3>
<p>Pertisau is a compact and tranquil village, with a handful shops, cafés and restaurants, and there is regular live music and folklore entertainment at hotels and local alms throughout the summer. It's a village with a great amount of history including being the getaway location for the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire – Emperor Maximilian. It's also known for its dark, rich, stone oils which have been extracted for an extraordinarily long time, which can be discovered at the Tiroler Steinöl Vitalberg visitor centre. Stay put in Pertisau, or head down the lake to discover Maurach. Valleys leading from both villages will have you going deep into the surrounding mountain ranges, with many diversions and paths along the way – perfect for exploring on foot or by bike.</p>
<h3>Lakeside setting</h3>
<p>Pertisau’s location is ideal for all water lovers with its setting on the Western shore of lake Achensee. The Strandbad Pertisau Lido is great for soaking up the sun and soothing your skin in the cool glacier water. Or, feel the light spray as you glide across the lake on a boat. Within minutes you leave the sights of Pertisau to enjoy stunning greenery and shallow shores. Stroll along the lakefront, switching sights between the lake and the Karwendel Mountains - the largest mountain range of the Northern Limestone Alps. A popular lakeside walk is to follow the undulating path from Pertisau to Gaisalm, then finished off with a boat ride back to where you started.</p>
<h3>Birds-eye views</h3>
<p>Head up the Rofan cable car to check out the breathtaking views of Lake Achensee from above. See how the region takes to responsible tourism along the educational nature trail, located close to the mountain lift station - featuring seven stations across 1.9 kilometres of trail, you’ll step into nature and see how to respect the local people, wildlife and environment – all while enjoying the spectacular views below you. If you're feeling brave, take to the skies in a paraglide and effortlessly float high above the pristine blue lake. Or, keep your feet on the ground and explore the 500 kilometres of marked hiking paths at your own pace.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Pertisau and lake Achensee has a great network of public transport and lifts that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>There are two lifts around Lake Achensee that operate during the summer, helping you reach the mountain tops to unlock a hiking paradise.</p>
<p>The Karwendel cable car departs from Pertisau and transports you to the Zwölferkopf area, where you can then walk onwards to the Bärenkopf or even further to the Stanserjoch.</p>
<p>The Rofan cable car departs from the south of the lake, in the village of Maurach. This cableway takes you up to heights of 1,840 metres, where beautiful walking routes start from the second you step foot out of the lift.</p>
<p>Tickets can be purchased locally from the ticket window in each of the lift stations.</p>

Wiesing and Jenbach can be reached too, however these routes are not included in the Guest Card and will be payable locally. This is an excellent way to reach new hiking areas, increasing your walking route options excessively.</p>

<p>The piers around the lake are:</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Enjoy a summer holiday in Pertisau, set on the Tyrol's largest and prettiest lake, framed by the Karwendel and Rofan mountains]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Pertisau</h2>
<h3>Lake cruises</h3>
<p>All aboard. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the panorama of Lake Achensee from the deck. Leisurely cruises with open air seating take sightseeing to a whole new level. Even better, the Achenseeschifffahrt boat tours combine with the Achenseebahn railway, making a great transport network exploration excursion. You can easily visit popular areas around the lake by boat like Maurach Seespitz, or Gaisalm, the haven of tranquillity.</p>
<h3>Lakeside lido</h3>
<p>Enjoy a dip in the lake at the Strandbad Pertisau lido. Top up your tan on the sunbathing lawn or cool down your skin in the fresh mountain water. With all the relevant facilities, set up camp as you have everything you need for a full day of shoreside entertainment.</p>
<h3>Wind and kitesurfing on Lake Achensee</h3>
<p>Take on the waves of Lake Achensee as the wind whisks you up and down across the turquoise waters. Feel the thrill as you wind and kite surf. Due to the lakes positioning and surrounding mountains, its prone to light southerly wind conditions on the lake in the morning, making it the perfect place to skim and jump weightlessly over the water.</p>
<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>Ride through the Falzturntal Valley along winding paths until you reach the Gramai Alm hut, perfect for a spot to eat before your seven-kilometre ride back to Pertisau. The Karwendel alpine park offers wide smooth paths down low, as well as rocky routes higher up – you may even need an e-bike to help with these more challenging incline routes.</p>
<h3>18-hole golf course</h3>
<p>Take to the green, bringing your putting skills from home all the way to the Alps. You can hire clubs, golf carts and trolleys on-site so all you need to do is bring your expertise. The breathtaking views and shining sun are a match made in heaven for any keen golfer.</p>
<h3>Tennis</h3>
<p>Visit the Sportcentre Pertisau for a game of tennis. You have access to four outdoor sand courts, and two indoor courts, meaning its often easy to snap one up for a game. Swing your racket and tally up the score as you battle to be the best.</p>
<h3>Segway hire</h3>
<p>Give your legs a rest and glide your way along the lakeside sidewalks and bike paths – letting off zero emissions. Tour the area in style, but remember, sturdy shoes are required, so leave the flip-flops back at the hotel for this one.</p>
<h3>Paragliding</h3>
<p>Soar above the pastel waters on the south side of Lake Achensee as your flight experience descends from the mountains. On your way down, look out for the other paragliders and hang-gliders as the area is renowned for its air sports. With two common starting points, will you choose the Karwendel zone on the left side, or the Rofan zone on the right?</p>
<h3>Cog railway steam-train</h3>
<p>Get a sense of history as you visit the 130-year old Achensee steam cog railway – the oldest of its kind in Europe. Puffing out steam, it makes its way from the station at Jenbach, up the mountain to Lake Achensee.</p>
<h3>Langlaufstuberl brewery visit</h3>
<p>Take a tour of the Achensee Bier brewery, where you'll view the large copper brewing chambers as you tour the most popular micro-brewery in the Tyrol. They also offer beer and cheese tasting experiences, with chance to dine in their own restaurant. Will you find your new favourite beer?</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>Wander through the Tyrolean stone oil Vitalberg, a unique adventure museum bringing together natural landscape and modern architecture. At the end, you can shop for hair care, skin care and body care products – made from naturally extracted local oils. Other traditional museums will keep you busy too.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map number 429, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the walking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Pertisau</h3>
<p>Pertisau offers excellent walking opportunities, with over 500 kilometres of marked hiking paths above the village and into local valleys Gerntal, Falzthurntal and the Tristenautal. Terrain ranges from flat walks to steeper trails up to the highest peaks accessed by two cable-cars. From most paths there are wonderful views of the lake and a great number of excellent mountain huts for refreshment stops.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The Achensee Tourist Office run their own hiking programme, included as part of your Achensee Guest Card given to you by your hotel.</p>
<p>Walks take place across different days of the week and different dates in the season and examples of walks that may be included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guided herb walk or ranger guided nature walk</li>
<li>Panorama hike</li>
<li>Nature watch tour to the Feilkopf</li>
<li>Nature watch tour to the Moosenalm</li>
<li>Summit tour in the Rofan or Karwendel mountains</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note cable cars, tolls and parking fees are not included and will incur an additional charge. These guided walks must be booked directly with the tourist office online no later than 8pm the day before the walk is set to take place.</p>
