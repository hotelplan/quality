  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk from Madrisaalp to Klosters via the stunning Schlappin mountain lake</li>
<li>Take the Bernina Express panoramic train along the UNESCO World Heritage Railway</li>
<li>Hire a bike and explore some of Davos Klosters' world-class trails</li>
</ul>
<p>Klosters was founded by the Premonstratensian priests who built a monastery here several centuries ago. By the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it had become a different sort of escape – a winter hideaway for the rich and famous, including the British royals, Audrey Hepburn and Gene Kelly (the guest books in the hotels and bars contain some of the most entertaining stories in town!). In summer, Klosters returns to its roots as a farming village, surrounded by working orchards, vineyards and farmsteads. The Landquart river runs through it all, with creeks and streams that keep the valley emerald-green – a super scenic backdrop to a Klosters walking holiday.  </p>
<h3>Klosters Platz: the heart of Klosters</h3>
<p>Klosters Platz is the centre of the village. The Reformed church marks the oldest part of town, sat on the foundations of the 13<sup>th</sup>-century monastery that gave Klosters its name. Pop your head in to admire the stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti, one of Switzerland’s first abstract painters. The rest of the rambling streets make for an interesting wander, too. Nutli-Hüschi is a farmhouse museum that tells the story of the German-speaking Walser people who emigrated here in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. You’ll also notice that restaurant menus lean towards alpine fare, including barley soup, smoked salmon, meatballs, potato rösti and cheesy raclette.</p>
<h3>Legendary Swiss trains and cable cars</h3>
<p>Klosters’ main station is at Klosters Platz, with trains to Davos, St. Moritz and beyond. From St. Moritz you can hop aboard the iconic Bernina Express for one of the most spectacular – and one of the highest – train journeys in the world. Cable cars also take you to great heights. The lift from Klosters Platz glides to the top of Gotschnagrat and its restaurant. Walks from here include the Davos Panoramic Trail – a high-rise hike above the west side of the valley, with views over mighty peaks and glaciers.</p>
<h3>Klosters Dorf: for family holidays</h3>
<p>Klosters has a second train station at Klosters Dorf (AKA Klosters village - the second half of the town). It’s just a few minutes’ walk away from the cable car that goes up the Madrisa mountain to Switzerland’s largest mountain adventure park - Madrisa Land. Kids can launch themselves full throttle into bouldering, slacklines, lake obstacle courses and hiking trails dotted with clues and puzzles.</p>
<h3>Visit Davos</h3>
<p>Nearby <a data-udi="umb://document/527f062dda374fee961e7ca5209c3d26" href="/{localLink:umb://document/527f062dda374fee961e7ca5209c3d26}" title="Davos">Davos</a> is a famous mountain city with a small-town feel, and it's just a half-hour train journey south of Klosters. Peruse its shops, cafés and museums to find out more about its history as a world-class research centre and artists’ retreat. There’s a lake for sailing, windsurfing, swimming and waterside walks. Davos is also home to an Adventure Park, which gets kids zooming through the forests of the Flüela Valley on zip lines and high ropes courses.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<p>The region around Klosters and Davos (just 20 minutes away by train) is a paradise for families, and young adventurers will find plenty of exciting things to do.</p>
<h3>Adventure playgrounds</h3>

<p>Over in nearby Davos, there's more fun to be had with numerous playgrounds at village level, as well as on the Rinerhorn and Schatzalp, where you'll find the exciting summer toboggan run and natural play elements in the forest.</p>
<h3>Davos Adventure Park</h3>

There's five high ropes courses, each with eight stations of varying difficulty plus a special children's course for ages four to eight.</p>
<p>The pump track and mountain bike park are fun for biking, and there's a skate park too - hire of bikes and skateboards is available. In addition, there's two children's playgrounds, plus a barbeque area and the Chalet Velo restaurant for when everyone gets hungry. </p>
<h3>Swimming and water sports</h3>

<p>Older children and teens will enjoy river rafting, wind or kite surfing or wakeboarding.</p>
<h3>Explore on two wheels</h3>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Parsenn to Gotschna panorama trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>7.2km</li>
<li>Expect to take around two to three hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting at the Parsenn mid-station you’ll head along the mountain range towards the Gotschnagrat, a mountain overlooking Klosters in the canton of Graubünden. Treat yourself along the way with a break in the Parsennhütte, before heading back off along the panoramic high-altitude route.</p>
<h3>Madrisaalp to Klosters Dorf via Schlappin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>8.7km</li>
<li>Expect to take three to four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>After taking the gondola up the Madrisa Mountain you can start your descent back down. Here you will face wide open fields and a grand backdrop before reaching the stunning blue lake in Schlappin. Once most of the downhill has taken place, you can stroll along the Schlappinbach stream back to Klosters Dorf.</p>
<h3>Selfranga and Aeuja loop</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>12.2km</li>
<li>Expect to take around four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the hidden gems you can reach from Klosters, a route that isn't overly populated, making it ideal for an undisturbed experience. Starting from the village you can set foot south in the direction of Davos, before diverting off on the circular route. There will be plenty of places for a pit-stop, such as the mountain restaurant in Selfranga.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<div class="webfx-tree-item">
<h2>Things to do in Klosters</h2>
<p>Klosters has a selection of shops and cafés, and the local Rhäetian railway connects guests to <a data-udi="umb://document/527f062dda374fee961e7ca5209c3d26" href="/{localLink:umb://document/527f062dda374fee961e7ca5209c3d26}" title="Davos">Davos</a> in only 20 minutes or to destinations such as the Swiss National Park and the Engadine valley.</p>
<h3>Hiking and Nordic walking</h3>
<p>Hiking poles may be needed for some of these walks, as the region has a 700-kilometre-long network of hiking routes - covering sunny side valleys, mountain peaks and alpine forests. For more gentle walks, take a stroll on wide paths from the village, or take a bus to Davosersee for an easy route around the lake. It's also a popular spot for Nordic walking, and you can rent Nordic walking poles locally.</p>
<h3>Mountain biking</h3>
<p>Within Davos Klosters, six lifts including funiculars allow mountain bikes to be taken inside, meaning you can reach high peaks quickly and efficiently, saving all your energy for the downhill run. From here, many single trails, graded by difficulty allow you to explore this biking paradise. Or, grab an e-bike to complete one of the uphill tours.</p>
<h3>Ride the famous Bernina Express panoramic train</h3>
<p>For the real wow factor, take the scenic Bernina Express Panoramic Train, which rolls through jaw-dropping scenery and over famous landmarks like the Landwasser Viaduct all the way to Tirano in Italy - a spectacular route that's easily completed there and back in a day from Filisur, not far from Davos.</p>
<h3>Strandbad Klosters outdoor swimming</h3>
<p>Soak up the sun on a warm day at the Klosters swimming pool. This large complex has a combination of lane swimming, diving pool, shallow splash pool and a swimming lake. You’ll also have access to on-site facilities and family friendly activities like a mini waterslide, climbing wall and playground. Or, just enjoy the fresh air as you relax on the bathing lawn.</p>
<h3>Klosters golf course</h3>
<p>Head to the Golf club Klosters, where the nine-hole course is beautifully laid out, stretching perfectly managed greens just above the village height – making great views alongside your game. Make sure to not hit the ball in the bunker though.</p>
<h3>Paragliding</h3>
<p>Put your harness, sunglasses and helmet on and head to the skies as you descend from the Jakobshorn mountain, close to Davos. Experience weightlessness and freedom as you float over the valley, a wonderful and thrilling experience for all adrenaline seekers.</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>Make your way to Davos, where the Kirchner Museum celebrates work of artist Ernst Kirchner - a vibrant exhibition. Or, the Davos Heritage Museum with the original wooden mill is a must for any history or geography enthusiast. Use your included Davos Klosters Premium Card to get discounted entry too.</p>
<h3>Restaurants in and around Klosters</h3>
<p>Klosters has a few beautiful industrial chic or traditional alpine restaurants to choose from in the evenings. Or, maybe you prefer to fill up at lunch time, in which the mountain restaurants like the Berghaus Alpenrösli serve top quality locally sourced food – delicious to say the least.</p>
<h3>Davos Schatzalp Alpine Botanical Garden</h3>
<p>Take a visit to the Alpine Botanical Garden Schatzalp, where there are 118 acres of forest and mountain pastures and five acres of beautiful gardens. The themed alpine gardens have names including belle époque, historical, Thomas Mann square and 'Guggerbachtal' (valley of the Guggerbach river), each with a different collection of plants - representing various areas of life. In total, the gardens are home to over 5,000 species of plant, with many hiking trails where the stunning flowers are blossoming.</p>
<h3>Festivals and events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Davos Klosters Sounds Good: jazz festival with some free concerts (normally around 6 - 13 July)</li>
<li>Davos Music Festival: classical music by young artists (normally around 3 - 17 Aug)</li>
<li>Swiss alpine Marathon (normally around 26 July)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Davos Klosters Summer Programme</h3>
<p>The Davos Klosters Summer Programme has activities and hikes throughout summer which normally includes weekly guided bike tours, tennis, windsurfing, a tour of highest-altitude Monstein brewery, E-biking, bowling, dairy visits and more. Your Davos Klosters Premium Card may get you discounts on some activities <em>(subject to change, some supplements may apply and equipment rental may be required)</em>.</p>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps and apps</h3>
<p>For Klosters we recommend picking up a walking map from the tourist office. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. You can often find these from the hotel reception area too.</p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingDescription></walkingDescription>
  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Davos</h3>
<p>There are around 700 kilometres of marked walking trails in the Davos Klosters region, offering a fabulous range of walks to suit all abilities and tastes. The vast walking area which covers both sides of the valley is accessed easily by cable-car or funicular from the village centres and the Davos Klosters Premium Card makes using the lifts much cheaper so you can explore the stunning terrain and get to the best view points, really easily.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The Davos Klosters Summer Guest Programme includes some guided hikes, and you can use your Davos Klosters Premium Card for a reduced rate to join. You can also visit the Tourist Office website to sign up to further guided walks - these need to be arranged directly with the Tourist Office two weeks in advance which can be done online.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
