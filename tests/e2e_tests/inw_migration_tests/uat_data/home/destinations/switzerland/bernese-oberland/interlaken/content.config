  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Take a leisurely lunchtime cruise on Lake Thun or Brienz</li>
<li>Admire the far-reaching views from Harder Kulm</li>
<li>Get adventurous with a thrilling paraglide or some canyoning in Switzerland's adventure capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Interlaken makes adventure easy and is a great base for a summer holiday. Sprawled out between the turquoise lakes of Thun and Brienz, this town launches you into the great outdoors in an array of memorable ways – from mountain hikes to sunset cruises. But for all the adventure on its doorstep, Interlaken is a relaxed home base. Sip a <em>kafi crème</em> at a sun-trap café or stroll downriver to the timber buildings of the old quarter. Interlaken is also the start of some of the most scenic rail journeys in Europe, all easily voyaged thanks to the expansive and reliable train network.</p>
<h2>Walking holidays in Interlaken</h2>
<p>Variety is the order of the day when it comes to walking in Interlaken and the Bernese Highlands. Easy waterside paths circuit Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. There are hill climbs – up Kleiner Rugen, perhaps, or to the hair-raising glass viewing platform at Harder Kulm (take the funicular one or both ways, depending on how lively you’re feeling). Worthwhile day trips include Grindelwald, where you can wander through meadows to the distant chimes of cowbells or the alpine botanical garden of the Schynige Platte near Wilderswil.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Interlaken: choose your adventure</h3>
<p>Rafting, canyoning, kayaking, stand-up paddling, zip lines, via Ferrata – you name it, and Interlaken has probably got it. Interlaken is also one of the top places in Switzerland for paragliding; watching adventurous souls land in Hohematte Park is practically a tradition here (popcorn optional). A lake cruise is a must - boats with panoramic picture windows glide between towns, passing vineyards and fairy-tale castles en route.</p>
<h3>Explore Interlaken</h3>
<p>Interlaken might have an adventurous spirit, but it remains a laid-back base. Picnic by the chilly waters of the River Aare, where only the daring dip their toes, before meandering on to Unterseen. This is the oldest neighbourhood in Interlaken, with a cobbled town square and houses laden with flowers. Restaurants gather here too, including chalet inns with röstis and rieslings on the menu.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into local cuisine, go for a tour and tasting at the Rugenbräu Brewery, which has been making alpine ales in the Bernese Oberland for decades. Or book a workshop at the Funky Chocolate Club to learn exactly what it takes to become a master chocolatier.</p>
<h3>Trails by train</h3>
<p>Trains sweep through the countryside around Interlaken, journeying up some of the highest mountains in the region. It’s easy to connect to the Jungfrau Railway, which chugs up to Jungfraujoch, the highest train station in Europe. Even in summer, the sure-footed can walk on the vast snowy glacier. Some of the most beautiful walks start from the village stations here – Grindelwald, <a data-udi="umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3}" title="Wengen">Wengen</a>, and <a data-udi="umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0}" title="Murren">Mürren</a> included. Elsewhere, the Brienz Rothorn Railway quite literally heats things up, serving passengers sausages cooked in the steam train’s engine.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Interlaken and the surrounding Jungfrau region has a fantastic network of trains, boats, mountain railways and lifts that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h3><strong>Trains and mountain railways</strong></h3>
<p>Trains are what make Switzerland such a pleasure to explore and Interlaken benefits from two train stations, Interlaken Ost (East) and West. From here, getting to surrounding villages, and further afield is really easy.</p>
<p>Mountain trains run from Interlaken up to the Harder Kulm for an impressive view of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz, and there's the Brienzer Rothorn steam train which chugs its way from Brienz (at the opposite side of Lake Brienz to Interlaken) high into the mountains. From Wilderswil, you can catch the historic cog railway to the Schynige Platte where there's great views, plenty of walking opportunities and an Alpine Garden with over 800 species of Alpine Flora.</p>
<p>Further into the Jungfrau Region, mountains trains run from Grindelwald up the Kleine Scheidegg side of the valley, linking the village to Kleine Scheidegg, Eiger Gletscher, and Wengen. You can even take the train all the way up to the Jungfraujoch - the highest railway station in Europe. Alternatively, head to Lauterbrunnen and taken the funicular up towards Mürren, a pretty traffic-free village that's only accessible by lift and is the gateway to the lifts up to the Schilthorn.</p>
<p>Routes and timetables are available locally. The best way to enjoy the trains is to pre-book a travel pass - see the Cards &amp; Passes tab for more information (supplements may apply locally for some routes).</p>
<h3><strong>Boats</strong></h3>
<p>Taking to the water is one of the must-do's when visiting Interlaken, and boat trips are available on both of the two lakes thanks to a fleet of 14 boats, including two paddle steamers. On Lake Brienz, the nostalgic Lötschberg paddle steamer links all the little places around the lake, including Brienz - at the far end, and the Giessbach Waterfalls. A lake cruise is the perfect way to discover more of Lake Thun, from pretty villages like Spiez, fairytale castles and the larger city of Thun. Gourmet cruises are also bookable locally. </p>
<h3><strong>Lifts</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the boats and mountain trains, cable cars and gondolas open up lots of walking possibilities, fun activities and stunning viewpoints, including:</p>
<p>In Grindelwald:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grindelwald First</li>
<li>Männlichen</li>
<li>Eiger Express</li>
<li>Pfingstegg</li>
</ul>
<p>In Wengen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Männlichen</li>
</ul>
<p>In Mürren:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stechelberg</li>
<li>Schilthorn</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Buses</strong></h3>
<p>There is a network of local buses helping you to explore the area surrounding Interlaken and the two lakes - Thun and Brienz. Buses within zones one and three are included with your Interlaken Guest Card that you receive from your hotel. Journeys outside this area require an additional ticket. Routes and timetables are available locally.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Lake Thun to Lake Brienz</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>7 km which is predominantly flat</li>
<li>Expect to take around 2 hours</li>
<li>Can be completed in either direction</li>
</ul>
<p>A great walk along the Aare River from Lake Thun to Lake Brienz passing the Weissenau ruin and many beautiful bridges on the way. The Aareburg café roughly half way has delicious cakes, coffee, breakfast and lunch. Towards the end of the walk there's the option to head up the Harder Kulm funicular - from the top there's a fantastic view of both lakes.</p>
<h3><strong>Wilderswil to Interlaken West</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>3.5 km which is predominantly flat</li>
<li>Expect to take at least 1 hour</li>
<li>Can be completed in either direction (there is some height gain from Interlaken West to Wilderswil but it is still an easy walk)</li>
</ul>
<p>A lovely short stroll from the quiet centre of Wilderswil back to Interlaken West station - perfect for a sunny morning. The route passes green fields of cows, a little forested area, old ruins and the Rugenbräu brewery.</p>
<h3><strong>Iseltwald to Giessbach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>6.5 km, with little height gain mostly at the waterfalls</li>
<li>Height gain between 220 and 676 metres depending on your route choice</li>
<li>Expect to take at least 1.5-2 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy a peaceful walk from Iseltwald along the edge of Lake Brienz to the thunderous Giessbach waterfalls which drop an amazing 14 levels down from the high mountains into Lake Brienz. At the falls a short circular walk offers amazing views - the route that takes you behind one of the falls is particularly impressive. Hop on a steam boat from Giessbach back to Interlaken at the end of the day.</p>
<h3><strong>Schynige Platte to Grindelwald First</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>16km with 690 - 860 metres of height gain depending which direction you walk in</li>
<li>Expect to take at least six hours</li>
<li>Can be completed in either direction</li>
<li>Best from beg-Jul to mid-Oct (Schynige cog railway open from 1 Jul)</li>
</ul>
<p>A stunning, panoramic point-to-point hike via the Faulhorn, the Bachalpsee mirror lake and the First Cliff Walk - you'll have incredible views every step of the way. The route can be completed in either direction and goes between the top station of the Grindelwald First gondola and the top of the Schynige Platte cog railway. You'll need to use the lift/public transport at either end so make sure to allow yourself enough time to not miss the last lift/train down.</p>
<p>The direction Schynige Plate to Grindelwald First has the most height gain but arguably the best views of the Jungfrau. </p>
<h3><strong>More great walking route ideas</strong></h3>
<p>You can view plenty more great ideas from <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.interlaken.ch/en/experiences/sport-adventure/hiking" target="_blank">Interlaken Tourism</a>, and your reps in resort can provide lots of recommendations.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Interlaken</h2>
<h3>Enchanting<strong> towns and villages</strong></h3>
<p>Interlaken may be the adventure capital of Europe, but that doesn't mean there aren't some wonderful towns and villages to leisurely wander through. Interlaken has its fair share of great shops, bars, and experiences including the Funky Chocolate Club where you can make your own Swiss chocolate.</p>
<p>A cruise along Lake Thun will take you to Thun itself, a bustling city with impressive architecture. The shores of Lake Thun are home to villages like Spiez which is known for its castle and rich history. Wine lovers will enjoy the vineyards in this stunning area.</p>
<p>Just ten minutes from Interlaken is Bönigen - a small village on the edge of Lake Brienz, where traditional wooden houses, rural life, and natural beauty combine to create a picture-perfect and peaceful lakeside setting.</p>
<h3>Relaxing lake cruises</h3>
<p>One of the best places to relax around Interlaken is undoubtedly aboard one of the cruises - book a culinary cruise for an extra special treat, and gaze at the view while you enjoy lunch on board. The shores of Lake Thun, with castles, vineyards, and the St. Beatus caves invite you to hop off and explore along your route.</p>
<p>On Lake Brienz, take a boat to the impressive Giessbach waterfalls, or all the way to Brienz, at the opposite end of the lake to Bönigen. Here you'll find the Brienzer Rothorn steam train which takes you high into the mountains, for - you guessed it - more incredible views.</p>
<h3>Spectacular viewpoints</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there's no shortage of these in the area. The funicular up Harder Kulm takes you to a viewing platform overlooking Interlaken and both its lakes while the Schynige Platte's historic steam cog railway from nearby Wilderswil takes you to an impressive Alpine Garden and a hut with daily alphorn performances.</p>
<p>Head further into the Jungfrau region with ease on the Swiss Transport Network to visit some of Switzerland's most famous destinations - the Jungfraujoch and the Schilthorn plus the villages of <a data-udi="umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da}" title="Grindelwald">Grindelwald,</a> <a data-udi="umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3}" title="Wengen">Wengen</a>, and <a data-udi="umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0}" title="Murren">Mürren.</a></p>
<p>Grindelwald is famous for the iconic Eiger mountain, while Wengen overlooks the incredible Lauterbrunnen valley. Between the two, the Jungraujoch is a col between two mountain peaks, and a staggering feat of engineering means you can visit easily - via a train through the Eiger mountain itself - to enjoy unrivaled views and visit the Ice Palace for an inside look at the glacier.</p>
<p>Mürren is a chocolate-box village, well worthy of exploring - head up the Schilthorn for a brunch in the revolving restaurant, visit the spy museum, or try the exciting Thrill Walk at Birg.</p>
<h3>Unique experiences</h3>
<p>Interlaken itself is quite a unique place, with its blend of adventure, culture, and pristine nature, but there are still some things that - even for Interlaken - are quite unique. The Ballenberg open-air museum is like going back in time and is Switzerland's only open-air museum. The historic buildings and traditional crafts showcase rural life as it once was, and covering an area of 66 hectares, there's plenty to see. </p>
<p>Sticking with the historic theme, the Brienzer Rothorn steam train is a real highlight to an Interlaken holiday, chugging from Brienz up into the mountains, where you can walk through alpine meadows, explore lush forests, and admire the view. The sausage train is a particular highlight - at the end of the journey on selected departures, you can enjoy a sausage that's been cooked in the steam engine itself along the route.</p>
<h3>Adventure and water sports</h3>
<p>There's no shortage of adventure and water sports on offer in Interlaken, from paragliding and bungee jumping to speed boats and canyoning. There's something for everyone, regardless of how full-throttle you want your adventure - head out for a relaxing afternoon on a paddleboard or kayak, or jump full-swing into the canyon on the canyon-swing. For the water lovers, there's rafting too, and of course, plenty of opportunities to swim. And, if you prefer your adventures up high, try the high ropes or some rock climbing and via Ferrata, the opportunities are endless.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>For Interlaken we recommend picking up a walking map from the tourist office. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. </p>

<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. <span>Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Why we love walking in Interlaken</strong></h3>
<p>There's an excellent selection of walking for all abilities in and around Interlaken and its lakes. With around 500 kilometres of marked walking trails and some of the most spectacular scenery the Alps has to offer, there's lots of reasons to love Interlaken but it's the variety we love the most. From easy rambles along the lakefront, to more challenging ridge walks or long adventures into the mountains.</p>
<p>There's some incredible viewpoints in easy access too, like the Harder Kulm or Schynige Platte, which is the starting point for several lovely walks, and has a stunning alpine garden. Wherever you choose, the views are jaw-dropping, the walking trails are varied and with the excellent network of trains, mountain railways and lifts, reaching the best viewpoints is a breeze.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
