  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Stroll through the picturesque town with views over the Lauterbrunnen valley</li>
<li>Hike the famous Eiger Trail beneath the north face of the iconic Eiger Mountain</li>
<li>Take a 'Royal Ride' on the open-top Männlichen cable-car</li>
</ul>
<p>Wengen basks on a sheltered and sunny plateau beneath the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau mountains. Once a farming village, it became sought-after by hikers and skiers after Mary Shelley and Byron waxed lyrical about the sublime views. They weren’t wrong, either. As part of the Jungfrau region, spectacular trails come as standard on a walking holiday to Wengen – and arriving is half the adventure. Wengen is only accessible by the trains that run from the Lauterbrunnen valley below. Once here, you’ll find yourself amongst wooden chalets and 19<sup>th</sup>-century belle époque hotels, a cable car that climbs up to the paths and panoramas of Männlichen mountain and mountain trains further into the Jungfrau region.</p>
<h2>Walking in Wengen and the Jungfrau</h2>
<p>Wengen is part of the Jungfrau region, where over 500 kilometers of footpaths crisscross the mountains. The paths that meander through pine forests and meadows from Wengen are a great starting point, heading onwards up to the more challenging trails beneath the mighty glaciers. The famous Eiger Trail, which traverses the base of the iconic north face of the Eiger mountain is on many a bucket list or you can easily explore further afield to the Lauterbrunnen valley, chocolate-box mountain villages like <a data-udi="umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0}" title="Murren">Mürren</a>, or <a data-udi="umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba}" title="Interlaken">Interlaken</a> with its bright turquoise lakes.</p>
<h3>A warm welcome in Wengen</h3>
<p>Although small, Wengen has been welcoming adventurous souls for a couple of hundred years, so it’s well-supplied with hotels, shops, and eateries. Edelweiss-embroidered tablecloths, cuckoo clocks, and handmade pottery stock the souvenir shops and clothes boutiques specialize in walking gear. The food leans towards the hearty here – think herby soups, mushroom ravioli, noodle-like spätzle, and strudels with generous dollops of cream. Fun is easy to find - try the mini-golf course, the giant chess board, the wooden marble run, or go for a dip at the outdoor swimming pool, framed by mountain views.</p>
<h3>The highest train stations in Switzerland</h3>
<p>Swiss engineering is as good as rumor has it, with trains and cable cars allowing wanderers to easily explore car-free. Some of the most famous train journeys include the track that runs all the way up to the Jungfraujoch – the highest railway station in Europe – or from <a data-udi="umb://document/dfa2f9c1883e4c128b45b95b3fdce109" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dfa2f9c1883e4c128b45b95b3fdce109}" title="Wilderswil">Wilderswil</a> to the Alpine gardens of the Schynige Platte.</p>
<h3>Take the family to Männlichen… al fresco</h3>
<p>A cable car links Wengen to Männlichen, a 2,343-metre mountain that watches over the Lauterbrunnen Valley on one side, and <a data-udi="umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da}" title="Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a> on the other. You can choose to ride inside… or on the open-air balcony on top of the cable car for the "Royal Ride" (just clutch your phone tight while taking a selfie). Many trails can be trodden from the mountaintop, including the Royal Walk to the crown viewpoint, the Treetop Trail and beautifully maintained trails between mountain huts. Come August, alpenhorn aficionados gather to play tunes in full traditional dress.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Wengen has a fantastic network of lifts and mountain railways that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h4>Trains and mountain railways</h4>
<p>Trains are what make Switzerland such a pleasure to explore and mountain trains run from Wengen in a variety of directions, linking the village to Wengernalp, Eiger Gletscher, Grindelwald and down to Lauterbrunnen and further afield. You can even take the train all the way up to the Jungfraujoch - the highest railway station in Europe - or reach the Schynige Platte from Wilderswil or the Harder Kulm from Interlaken.</p>
<p>Routes and timetables are available locally. The best way to enjoy the trains is to pre-book a travel pass - see the Cards &amp; Passes tab for more information - supplements may apply locally for some routes.</p>
<h4>Lifts</h4>
<p>In addition to the mountain trains, cable cars and gondolas open up lots of walking possibilities, fun activities and stunning viewpoints, including:</p>
<p>In Wengen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Männlichen</li>
</ul>
<p>In Grindelwald:</p>

  <guidedWalks><![CDATA[<h3>Inghams Guided Walks are included on your holiday in Wengen</h3>
<p>We’ve included two walks per week (between 26 May - 11 Sep 25) in Wengen and Grindelwald, just for Inghams guests. Join a small group and be led by a professional walking guide on some of their favourite trails. It’s a great way to get to know the area. The walks in Wengen and Grindelwald and are run by Tina Gertsch at Outdoor. </p>
<p>There are three walks to choose from each week and each walk has a limited number of spaces. All walks are available to guests staying in both Grindelwald and Wengen, and you can choose up to two per person, per week. Most walks require the use of public buses/trains and/or mountain lifts which are payable locally. You can add the walks onto your holiday by calling us on 01483 319 652.</p>
<h4>Romantic Trail (half day)</h4>
<p>Get that high mountain feeling and surround yourself with incredible scenery on a spectacular walk from the top of the Männlichen Gondola to Kleine Scheidegg. We follow the Romantic Trail through alpine meadows dotted with wildflowers - at the right time of year, you can spot wild anemones, gentians, alpine roses and cotton grass. Views stretch across the valley towards Grindelwald and the surrounding mountain peaks including the impressive Eiger Mountain.</p>

The Männlichen Gondola is required at the start of the walk and a train is required at the end (all payable locally).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run: every Monday</p>
<h4>The famous Eiger Trail (full day)</h4>
<p>This is a real bucket-list walk, with incredible views and a trail that follows the base of the Eiger Mountain. Starting with a scenic train or cable car to Eigergletscher, you follow the famous Eiger Trail which traverses – mainly in the shade - below the North Face of the Eiger Mountain, looking over Grindelwald. Get stories of first ascents along with beautiful views and the chance to spot wildflowers and marmots. If you’re going to do one hike in the Jungfrau, this Alpine classic should be on your list.</p>

<h4>Gletscherschlucht (Glacier Gorge) (half day)</h4>
<p>This walk is a real experience, and one not to be missed. A relatively easy walk, from Grindelwald to the stunning Glacier Gorge, where entry is included. Enjoy a pleasant, fairly flat route there and back with interesting information provided on route by your local guide. Along the way, you’ll learn about the history and evolution of glaciers in the Alps, geology and the formation of the gorge.</p>

<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 100m ascent and descent</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> generally flat with wider paths (can be slightly uneven in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: You'll visit the glacier gorge where entry is included. This is a half day walk in the morning so there's no hut stop for lunch, but you'll be back in Wengen in time to enjoy a bite to eat in one of the many cafés.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run on: every Thursday</p>
<p><strong>For every walk you will need: </strong>suitable walking shoes/boots with good grip, appropriate walking clothing, sun cream, insect repellent, sunglasses, rain jacket, a warmer layer, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a snack, cash for mountain huts and your travel pass if you’ve purchased one.

Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavour to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking.

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h4>Lauterbrunnen to Stechelberg</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>6.79km with 133 metres of height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>On this walk, it's all about the amazing waterfalls that you'll see on the way. There's 72 in the valley and this trail takes you past some of the best ones. The route follows a valley trail from Lauterbrunnen train station, the village below Wengen, to the Stechelberg bus station. Enjoy a bite to each in the village before returning on public transport.</p>
<h4>Mettlenalp and Wengernalp</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>9.54km with 658 metres of height gain </li>
<li>Expect to take around three hours</li>
<li>Can be completed in reverse if you prefer walking downhill</li>
</ul>
<p>Glacier views, Lauterbrunnen valley views, mountain views - this walk ticks all the boxes. From Wengen, head past the Tschuggen ridge and traverse the open slopes below the glaciers and the peaks of the Jungfrau and Mönch. The views are incredible in all directions with the Lauterbrunnen valley on one side, and the dramatic mountain peaks on another. After Mettlenalp, zig-zag up through the forest to Wengernalp and catch the train back to Wengen. </p>
<h4>Panorama Path Männlichen to Kleine Scheidegg</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>4.63km with 161 metres of height loss</li>
<li>Expect to take around one a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Take in the view as you wander along this pleasant, easy-to-follow gravel road, past Honegg and the rocky spur of the Lauberhorn. The route can easily be extended by continuing from Kleine Scheidegg up to the Eigergletcher station past the spectacular Fallboden lake with the Eiger as it's back drop. This will add around three kilometres and 270 metres of height gain, making it more of a moderate walk.</p>
<h4>Eiger Trail to Alpiglen</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to challenging walk</li>
<li>6.1km with 78 metres of height gain and 779 metres of height loss</li>
<li>Expect to take around two hours</li>

<p>The dramatic north face of the Eiger mountain is the main feature of this stunning hike. Traverse steep alpine meadows and scree slopes from the Eigergletscher station towards Alpiglen and take plenty of photos on route. From Alpiglen you can return by train or continue to Gletscherschlucht for a bigger challenge.</p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Wengen</h2>
<h3>Picturesque mountain villages</h3>
<p>Wengen is full of character with wooden chalets, belle époque hotels, and charming cafés. Head further afield to chocolate-box <a href="/%7blocalLink:umb:/document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0%7d">Mürren</a> and take a gondola ride over the Männlichen mountain to the glacier village of <a data-udi="umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0fe9200934b24cd49d20e1cea080f5da}" title="Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a>.</p>
<p>Nearby <a href="/%7blocalLink:umb:/document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba%7d">Interlaken</a> is a busier town so spend some time exploring the shops and restaurants, take a lunch cruise on the lake, and head up to the Harder Kulm for some amazing views of the stunning blue lakes.</p>
<h3>Picture-perfect viewpoints</h3>
<p>Everywhere you look is spectacular. There are a few places that deserve a special mention though, the most famous of which is the <a href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfraujoch-top-of-europe/">Jungfraujoch</a>.</p>
<h3>Jungfraujoch - Top of Europe</h3>
<p>If you've got a bucket list of incredible places to see, the view from the Jungfraujoch needs to be on it. At 3,454 meters above sea level and surrounded by glaciers and staggering 4000-metre peaks, it's hard to beat the views from here. The Eiger Express gondola and train ride through the mountain make the journey to get there just as impressive. Make sure you visit the ice palace too - get a closer look at the magnificent glacier from the inside and see some impressive sculptures.</p>
<h3>Grindelwald First Cliff Walk</h3>
<p>Admire the view from the metal walkway on the First Cliff walk near the top of the Grindelwald First gondola. The exciting cliff walkway clings to the edge of the mountain and has a suspension bridge and a 45-meter-long terrace that sticks out above the valley.</p>
<h3>Schilthorn</h3>
<p>The peaks of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau mountains dominate the view from the Schilthorn, which you might recognise from the James Bond film 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Visit the spy exhibition and enjoy a delicious brunch in the 360-degree revolving restaurant. The <a href="https://schilthorn.ch/23/en/Thrill_Walk">thrill walk</a> at Birg, a little further down the mountain, is a network of metal walkways bolted into the mountainside - test your head for heights and get some incredible photos.</p>
<h3>Schynige Platte</h3>
<p>You'll need plenty of time to admire the view from the top of the Schynige Platte - a cog railway that goes from <a href="/%7blocalLink:umb:/document/dfa2f9c1883e4c128b45b95b3fdce109%7d">Wilderswil</a> up to this beautiful viewpoint. In one direction, the peaks of the Jungfrau, Mönch, and Eiger dominate the skyline and in another, the bright blue waters of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz glisten in the sun. It's the starting point for many great walks, or if you're keen on a more relaxing visit, enjoy lunch in the panorama restaurant and a live Alphorn concert (daily between 11 am - 2 pm by the railway station). Children will love the playground and treasure hunt. (Schynige cog railway open from around 14 Jun).</p>
<h3>UNESCO World Heritage waterfalls</h3>
<p>The Trümmelbach waterfalls are a natural spectacle and unique in Europe. Bright blue water from the huge glaciers above flows over ten waterfalls through a narrow glacial gorge with rock walls tens of meters high. </p>
<h3>Activities for the adventurous</h3>
<p>Test your head for heights on the K3 via Ferrata above the Lauterbrunnen Valley or hire mountain bikes and explore on two wheels. Try the glacier canyon swing or zip lines in Grindelwald, there's plenty of adrenaline-pumping activities in the Jungfrau region and the transport network makes getting between the villages nice and easy.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h4>Recommended equipment</h4>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for walking around Wengen and the Jungfrau. There's plenty of places to buy walking equipment in Wengen and you can rent poles from Intersport (Central Sport).</p>
<h4>Walking maps</h4>
<p>For Wengen and the Jungfrau we recommend picking up a walking map from the Tourist Office. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin.</p>
<p>You can see the status of the hiking routes online via the <a rel="noopener" href="https://maps.jungfrauferien.ch/hiking/" target="_blank">interactive map</a>, which shows you what routes are open. There's an interactive map for the <a rel="noopener" href="https://wengen.swiss/en/summer/planning-and-events/mountain-railways/operating-statuses/" target="_blank">mountain railways</a> too.</p>
<p>The Jungfrau app is great for weather updates and walking ideas and is available on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/jungfrau/id1465310312" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alturos.jbm&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" data-anchor="?id=app.alturos.jbm&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>.</p>
<h4>Walking guidelines</h4>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
