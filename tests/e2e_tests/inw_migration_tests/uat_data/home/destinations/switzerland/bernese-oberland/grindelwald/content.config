  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>See the impressive rock formations in the Gletscherschluct Gorge</li>
<li>Visit the Jungfraujoch - Top of Europe for the most magnificent views</li>
<li>Embrace the adventure at Grindelwald First with the Cliff Walk or a go on the zip lines</li>
</ul>
<p>Summer holidays in Grindelwald are really special. Forget about dark wizards and wands – the <em>real</em> Grindelwald is magic for altogether different reasons. The village looks up to the Lower Grindelwald Glacier and is watched over by a wall of peaks, including the 4,000-metre-plus Mönch and the looming north face of the Eiger. Walks in Grindelwald range from Alpine epics like the Eiger Trail to family-friendly rambles and getting from A to B is easy, thanks to the gondolas and trains that wind their way up to improbable heights. Back in Grindelwald, sunny terraces are laid out for marveling at the huge mountains that kicked off the 19th-century golden age of alpinism.  </p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Grindelwald</h3>
<p>A gondola connects Grindelwald to First, on the scenic Schwarzhorn mountain north of the village. It's a haven for summer activities and incredible mountain views. Grab a bite to eat with views over peaks and glaciers, and dare to fly down the ziplines - four friends at a time can whizz down the First Flyer, or fly like an eagle on the First Glider. Release the kids onto the alpine playground or mountain kart tracks and if you have a good head for heights, take on the Cliff Walk. Keen hikers can set off for the mountain lake of Bachalpsee and on to the ridgetop Alpine gardens and mountain station of Schynige Platte before returning by cog railway and train. Or, head towards the Grosse Scheidegg mountain pass, a great spot to enjoy sunset.</p>
<h3>Visit the Jungfraujoch: top of Europe</h3>
<p>Grindelwald is the gateway to the Jungfraujoch – the seat between two of the highest mountains in the Bernese Alps. The views are even more impressive in the summer. To get there, catch the Eiger Express mountain lift to the Eiger Gletscher station, which sits on the mountain ridge between Grindelwald and <a data-udi="umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3}" title="Wengen">Wengen</a>, and then hop on a train to the highest train station in Europe. On arrival, you’ll be treated to panoramas of the vast Aletsch Glacier - the longest in Europe. It's easy to spend a few hours of your holiday up here, admiring the views of the glacier from inside as well as out - take a walk through the Ice Palace for an inside look at this wonderful world of ice.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in Grindelwald: Interlaken and the lakes</h3>
<p>The arrival of the railway transformed Grindelwald from a mountain climbing base to the Jungfrau region’s biggest summer holiday destination. Catch the train down the valley to <a data-udi="umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba}" title="Interlaken">Interlaken</a>, the adventure capital of Switzerland. From here, you can wander the half-timbered houses of the old town, jump aboard a glass-roofed boat for a cruise on the brilliant turquoise waters of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz (a perfect summer holiday activity), or take the funicular up to Harder Kulm to admire the lakes from above. Paragliding is a favorite activity here, too.</p>
<h3>Mountain adventures on family holidays in Grindelwald</h3>
<p>Grindelwald First is for high-adrenalin family fun, while the Pfingstegg area specializes in more laid-back mountain adventures – lazy zip lines that loop through the trees and a summer toboggan. There are also lots of mountain biking trails in the summer around Grindelwald, plus canyoning routes, adventure playgrounds, and an indoor rope park. Another lift goes up to Männlichen, where there’s a treetop walk and a playground themed around Lieselotte, the beloved storybook cow.</p>

<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time at your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Jungfrau's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<p>Grindelwald is like a huge adventure playground for all ages, and there's lots to keep all ages entertained.</p>
<h3>Adrenaline rush at Grindelwald First</h3>
<p>Grindelwald First is nicknamed Top of Adventure - so it's no surprise you'll find heaps of fun things to do here. Whizz down the mountain on the First Flyer or First Glider zip lines or try the exhilarating First Cliff Walk, suspended high above the valley below. You can also rent mountain carts or Trottibikes to make your way down the mountain on wheels.</p>
<h3>Pfingstegg fun</h3>
<p>There's fun to be had for all the family at the top of the Pfingstegg lift. Feel the thrills on the summer toboggan run or meander through the trees high above the ground on the Fly Line - this is a calmer version of a zip line that still offers lots of fun.</p>
<h3>Discover Lieselotte the cow</h3>
<p>Head to the Sennen playground at Männlichen and see Lieselotte, the famous cow, with her own play area (there are trampolines, climbing frames, swings, and a huge wooden cow that hides a fun slide) and themed walking trail with fun stations along the way. You can also follow the Royal Walk up to the summit for some incredible views.</p>
<h3>Minigolf and orienteering</h3>
<p>Head to Grindelwald's main street and take on the family at Minigolf - 18 holes offer fun and challenge for all the family. Keen navigators and families looking for a challenge will love the Swiss-O Finder orienteering challenges - two walking routes from the Grindelwald Sport's Centre allow you to experience the glacier village in a different way and take you to the best viewpoints in Grindelwald.</p>
<h3>Indoor activities in Grindelwald</h3>
<p>Switzerland's first indoor high ropes pare is in Grindelwald and offers five exciting routes of varying difficulty - follow the routes between wooden platforms, wire ropes, and knotted nets, all under cover. Climbers will love the indoor boulder hall, and there's Grindelwald indoor swimming pool for the water-lovers - there's a dedicated children's pool and a "black-hole" slide. </p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Grindelwald has a fantastic network of lifts and mountain railways that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<h3>Trains and mountain railways</h3>
<p>Trains are what make Switzerland such a pleasure to explore and mountain trains run from Grindelwald up the Kleine Scheidegg side of the valley, linking the village to Kleine Scheidegg, Eiger Gletscher, Wengen and further afield. You can even take the train all the way up to the Jungfraujoch - the highest railway station in Europe - or reach the Schynige Platte from Wilderswil or the Harder Kulm from Interlaken.</p>
<p>Routes and timetables are available locally. The best way to enjoy the trains is to pre-book a travel pass - see the Cards &amp; Passes tab for more information - supplements may apply locally for some routes.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>In addition to the mountain trains, cable cars and gondolas open up lots of walking possibilities, fun activities and stunning viewpoints, including:</p>
<p>In Grindelwald:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grindelwald First</li>
<li>Männlichen</li>
<li>Eiger Express</li>
<li>Pfingstegg</li>
</ul>
<p>In Wengen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Männlichen</li>
</ul>
<p>In Mürren:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stechelberg</li>
<li>Schilthorn</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>There are five different buses services available from the centre of the village connecting you to nearby places such as the Grosse Scheidegg. Routes and timetables are available locally.</p>]]></gettingAround>
  <gettingAroundTitle><![CDATA[Getting around Grindelwald and the Jungfrau]]></gettingAroundTitle>
  <guidedWalks><![CDATA[<h3>Inghams Guided Walks are included on your holiday in Grindelwald</h3>
<p>We’ve included two walks per week (between 26 May - 11 Sep 25) in Grindelwald and Wengen, just for Inghams guests. Join a small group and be led by a professional walking guide on some of their favourite trails. It’s a great way to get to know the area. The walks in Grindelwald and Wengen are run by Tina Gertsch at Outdoor.</p>
<p>There are three walks to choose from each week and each walk has a limited number of spaces. All walks are available to guests staying in both Grindelwald and Wengen, and you can choose up to two per person, per week. Most walks require the use of public buses/trains and/or mountain lifts which are payable locally. You can add the walks onto your holiday by calling us on 01483 319 652.</p>
<h4>Romantic Trail (half day)</h4>
<p>Get that high mountain feeling and surround yourself with incredible scenery on a spectacular walk from the top of the Männlichen Gondola to Kleine Scheidegg. We follow the Romantic Trail through alpine meadows dotted with wildflowers - at the right time of year, you can spot wild anemones, gentians, alpine roses and cotton grass. Views stretch across the valley towards Grindelwald and the surrounding mountain peaks including the impressive Eiger Mountain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> easy - moderate (reasonable fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time</strong>: approx. 3 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent:</strong> 200m ascent and 350m descent</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Mainly gravel tracks or single-track footpaths (may be a little uneven in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information:</strong> This is a half day walk in the morning so there's no hut stop for lunch, but you'll be back in Grindelwald in time to enjoy a bite to eat in one of the many cafés. The Männlichen Gondola is required at the start of the walk and a train is required at the end (all payable locally).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run: every Monday</p>
<h4>The famous Eiger Trail (full day)</h4>
<p>This is a real bucket-list walk, with incredible views and a trail that follows the base of the Eiger Mountain. Starting with a scenic train or cable car to Eigergletscher, you follow the famous Eiger Trail which traverses – mainly in the shade - below the North Face of the Eiger Mountain, looking over Grindelwald. Get stories of first ascents along with beautiful views and the chance to spot wildflowers and marmots. If you’re going to do one hike in the Jungfrau, this Alpine classic should be on your list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade:</strong> moderate to challenging (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 6km</li>
<li><strong>Walking time:</strong> 3.5 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent:</strong> 120m ascent and 820m descent</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> varied mountain terrain which is mainly narrow rocky paths (can be quite uneven and steep)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: There will be a late lunch stop at Alpiglen restaurant (payable locally) or you can take a picnic lunch. The cable car or train is required at the start of the walk and the train at the end of the walk (both payable locally).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run: every Tuesday</p>
<h4>Gletscherschlucht (Glacier Gorge) (half day)</h4>
<p>This walk is a real experience, and one not to be missed. A relatively easy walk, from Grindelwald to the stunning Glacier Gorge, where entry is included. Enjoy a pleasant, fairly flat route there and back with interesting information provided on route by your local guide. Along the way, you’ll learn about the history and evolution of glaciers in the Alps, geology and the formation of the gorge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: easy (basic fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance:</strong> 7km</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: approx. 3 hours</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 100m ascent and descent</li>
<li><strong>Terrain:</strong> generally flat with wider paths (can be slightly uneven in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: You'll visit the glacier gorge where entry is included. This is a half day walk in the morning so there's no hut stop for lunch, but you'll be back in Grindelwald in time to enjoy a bite to eat in one of the many cafés.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Summer 25, this walk will run: every Thursday</p>
<p><strong>For every walk you will need: </strong>suitable walking shoes/boots with good grip, appropriate walking clothing, sun cream, insect repellent, sunglasses, rain jacket, a warmer layer, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a snack, cash for mountain huts and your travel pass if you’ve purchased one. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<p><em>Early booking is strongly recommended as spaces are limited. All walks are subject to availability of local guides, weather conditions and maximum numbers. Planned routes are subject to change. Any distances and ascents/descents stated are approximate. Full details of the walks with the meeting points and routes will be provided to you on arrival. In some instances, there may be a small charge for local transport that is payable locally. In resorts where the walks run over more than two days, the day of the walk will be allocated to you by your Rep in your welcome meeting. Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavor to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking. The decision of the guide on the suitability of the walk for you is final and no compensation will be paid where the guide believes, in their professional opinion, that it is not suitable. Please ensure you are well-equipped for the walk have suitable clothing and footwear. Walks are not recommended for guests under 12 years. Any guests under 18 years will need to be accompanied by an adult.</em></p>]]></guidedWalks>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Mountain Panorama Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk, great for the whole family</li>
<li>5.6km, expect to take around two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll have stunning views of the Wetterhorn, Schreckhorn and Eiger mountains on this route and there's plenty of wild flowers to spot, too. It begins at the top of the First gondola and follows an undulating, wide open trail to the Grosse Scheidegg where you can have a bite to eat while you take in the view.</p>
<h3>Bachalp Lake and First Cliff Walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy to moderate walk</li>
<li>5.9km, expect to take two hours, plus 20 minutes if you do the cliff walk as well</li>
</ul>
<p>A beautiful route to the Bachalp Lake with stunning views, flower filled meadows and rustic farms - if the weather is calm when you reach the lake, you often get a mirror reflection of the surrounding mountains. The route begins at the top of the First gondola and has a steep incline to start but then widens into a gentle, undulating path to the lake. On the way back, the First Cliff walk with metal walkways in the cliff face provides fantastic photo opportunities and is an exciting way to finish a stunning route.</p>
<h3>Kleine Scheidegg to Eigergletscher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>3km, expect to take one and a half hours</li>
<li>Best from mid-Jun to mid-Oct</li>
</ul>
<p>Pass the Fallbodensee, a spectacular mountain lake with the Eiger as its backdrop. From Hotel Bellevue at the Kleine Scheidegg this route heads uphill, following the railway track in the direction of the Eiger mountain. After the lake, the path continues upwards to Loucherflue to the Eigergletscher station - the glacier has retreated a lot but is still incredible to see from here.</p>
<h3>Eiger Trail to Alpiglen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to challenging hike</li>
<li>6.1km, expect to take around two hours</li>
<li>Best from mid-Jun to mid-Oct</li>
<li>This trail is mostly downhill but you can do it in reverse if you'd prefer uphill</li>
</ul>
<p>The views on this trail are some of the best around, looking down on Grindelwald from beneath the towering Eiger north face. From the Eigergletscher station, follow signs to the Eiger trail which traverses the steep alpine slopes and scree fields of the north face of the Eiger mountain and zig-zags down to Alpiglen. From Alpiglen you can either catch the train back to Grindelwald, or the trail continues to Gletscherschlucht - this section of trail is steeper and more challenging. </p>
<h3>Schynige Platte to Grindelwald First</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>16km with 690 - 860 metres of height gain depending which direction you walk in</li>
<li>Expect to take at least six hours</li>
<li>Can be completed in either direction</li>
<li>Best from beg-Jul to mid-Oct (Schynige cog railway open from 1 Jul)</li>
</ul>
<p>A stunning, panoramic point-to-point hike via the Faulhorn, the Bachalpsee mirror lake and the First Cliff Walk - you'll have incredible views every step of the way. The route can be completed in either direction and goes between the top station of the Grindelwald First gondola and the top of the Schynige Platte cog railway. You'll need to use the lift/public transport at either end so make sure to allow yourself enough time to not miss the last lift/train down.</p>
<p>The direction Schynige Plate to Grindelwald First has the most height gain but arguably the best views of the Jungfrau. </p>
<h3>Lieselotte Children's Theme Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy, family friendly hike</li>
<li>3.7km with 608 metres of descent</li>
<li>Expect to take around one and a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy the view and discover the 13 play stations along the trail of Lieselotte the cow and her friends. From the top of the Männlichen gondola to the middle station, there's lots to discover and plenty of fun and games on the way.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Summer holidays in Grindelwald are all about views and adventure beneath the mighty Eiger Mountain]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Authentic mountain villages</h3>
<p>Nicknamed the Eiger village or the glacier village, Grindelwald is loved for its diversity of summer activities, excursions, and walking. The charming village is home to chalet-style houses and a good variety of cafés, restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>Exploring further afield is easy - take the train over the mountain to <a data-udi="umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3" href="/{localLink:umb://document/dd4c4793225641fcb24c0918a33714b3}" title="Wengen">Wengen</a>, visit chocolate-box <a data-udi="umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/51984d8419bc459f98223009757f4ed0}" title="Murren">Mürren</a>, or head to <a data-udi="umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba" href="/{localLink:umb://document/7456bae57241449a84a68959b62b2aba}" title="Interlaken">Interlaken</a>, a busier town between Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. Explore the shops and restaurants, take a lunch cruise on the lake, or head up high for some amazing views.</p>
<h3>Remarkable viewpoints</h3>
<p>When you head out walking around Grindelwald and the Jungfrau, everywhere you look is a remarkable viewpoint. There are a few that deserve a special mention though, the most famous of which is the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfraujoch-top-of-europe/" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Jungfraujoch - Top of Europe</strong></p>
<p>The views from 3,454 meters above sea level are incredible. Looking down on the Aletsch glacier (the longest in Europe), you're surrounded by staggering 4,000m peaks and dramatic scenery. The Eiger Express gondola and the train through the mountain make the journey to get there just as impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Grindelwald First Cliff Walk</strong></p>
<p>Get the ultimate photo from the First Cliff Walk - an exciting metal walkway that clings to the edge of the cliff and a 45-meter-long terrace that juts out over the valley below. It's a short walk from the top of the Grindelwald First gondola and is definitely worth a visit.</p>
<p><strong>Schilthorn</strong></p>
<p>The Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau mountains dominate the view from the <a rel="noopener" href="https://schilthorn.ch/en/Info/Piz_Gloria_2970_m_._9744_ft" target="_blank">Schilthorn</a>, a stunning mountain peak above Mürren. It's the location for a famous James Bond and you can visit the dedicated museum and enjoy a delicious brunch in the 360-degree revolving restaurant. The <a rel="noopener" href="https://schilthorn.ch/23/en/Thrill_Walk" target="_blank">thrill walk</a> at Birg is a little further along the mountain. It's a network of metal walkways bolted into the mountainside - test your head for heights and get some incredible photos.</p>
<p><strong>Schynige Platte</strong></p>
<p>You'll need plenty of time to admire the view from the top of the Schynige Platte. In one direction, the peaks of the Jungfrau, Mönch, and Eiger dominate the skyline and in another, you'll see the bright blue waters of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. It's the starting point for many great walks. (Schynige cog railway opens 14 Jun).</p>
<h3>Get the adrenaline pumping</h3>
<p>Race your friends at up to 80 kilometres an hour down the First Flyer zip line, or glide like an eagle on the First Glider - in Grindelwald, there are plenty of activities that adventurous teens and adults will love.</p>
<p>Make your mountain descent much closer to the ground by hiring mountain carts or Trottibike scooters. Hire a mountain bike or e-bike and explore the mountain on two wheels or test your head for heights on the K3 via ferrata above the Lauterbrunnen valley.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Grindelwald and the Jungfrau. There's plenty of places to buy walking equipment and you can rent poles from the Intersport (Rent Network) in Grindelwald centre.</p>
<h3>Walking maps and apps</h3>
<p>For Grindelwald and the Jungfrau we recommend picking up a walking map from the Tourist Office. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin.</p>
<p>You can see the status of the hiking routes online via the <a rel="noopener" href="https://maps.jungfrauferien.ch/hiking/" target="_blank">interactive map</a>, which shows you which routes are open. There's an interactive map for the <a rel="noopener" href="https://wengen.swiss/en/summer/planning-and-events/mountain-railways/operating-statuses/" target="_blank">mountain railways</a> too.</p>
<p>The Jungfrau app is great for weather updates and walking ideas and is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/jungfrau/id1465310312">App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alturos.jbm&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" data-anchor="?id=app.alturos.jbm&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
