  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk along the historic irrigation channels that carry water from rivers to pastures</li>
<li>Refuel with some traditional Swiss food in a rustic mountain hut</li>
<li>Indulge in some relaxation at the 'Spa des Bisses'</li>
</ul>
<p>From serene walks along historic bisses to challenging hikes up Alpine peaks, Nendaz offers something for every walker. Whether you’re seeking adventure or relaxation, you’ll have an unforgettable walking experience here in Nendaz. Amble along the bisses, head through the pastures or take up the Tracouet gondola up for the starting point of a number of walks.</p>
<h2>Walking in Nendaz</h2>
<p>There are over 250 kilometres of hiking trails catering to all skill levels across Nendaz. This region is famous for its breath-taking alpine scenery, well-marked paths, and varied landscapes. You can enjoy a leisurely walk along the Bisse de Saxon, a historic irrigation channel that transports water from mountain streams to pastures, fields, and orchards, or get spectacular views of the Four Valleys with a hike up to Dent de Nendaz. As one of Switzerland's largest raspberry and apricot growing areas, Nendaz features a themed trail dedicated to fruit cultivation. Additionally, you can hike to some of Europe's largest larch trees on the Balavaux Alp or explore the exotic beauty of the Japanese Garden.</p>
<h3>Explore new heights at Mont Fort</h3>
<p>At 3,330 metres above sea level, Mont-Fort offers incredible picture-perfect views over the Alps. To get there you can take the local bus over to Siviez and take the Tortin chairlift and the Col des Gentianes onto the Mont Fort. Once you have reached the summit, marvel at some of the most iconic mountain peaks in Europe, including the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, the Grand Combin and the Dent d’ Hérens. For those seeking an adrenaline rush speed down the Mont-Fort zipline with speeds of over 100 kilometres per hour, it is a unique way to get down. If you want to keep your feet on the ground, take the lifts back down to Siviez and enjoy walking along Bisse de Saxon, the longest bisse in the Valais back to Nendaz.</p>
<h3>Family-friendly walking holidays</h3>
<p>Nendaz has been awarded the Family Destination label recognising that the destination caters well for children and families, and it's easy to see why. It's an ideal destination for the whole family - from treasure-hunt walks through the mountains to workshops with their mascot "Cheesy", there's something to keep everyone occupied. Children will have fun climbing and jumping at Cheesy’s village or at one of the many playgrounds up and down the mountain. There are weekly workshops where the kids can get creative or bake tasty biscuits with the experts. For a day filled with adventures, follow one of the treasure hunts for a reward, venture through the old town of Haute Nendaz or stroll along the Bisse du Milie– adventure logbooks can be picked up from the tourist office or downloaded online.</p>
<h3>Relaxing holidays in Nendaz</h3>
<p>Nendaz isn't just about adventure; it's also a sanctuary for those seeking tranquillity. Unwind in the extensive spa at the Nendaz Four Valleys Hotel &amp; Spa, savour the flavours of local cuisine in charming mountain restaurants, or meander through the sculpture path. The village itself exudes charm, with its traditional chalet-style buildings with window boxes overflowing with flowers, welcoming locals, and a vibrant cultural scene that brings the spirit of the Alps to life.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Sculpture path</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy, family-friend walks</li>
<li>Approx. 2.6km</li>
<li>Expect to take around 45 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Meander through the fields and woodlands in and around Haute-Nendaz, and encounter the sculptures inspired by local legends. Starting at Nendaz Tourism, follow the 'Promenade des Crêtes' through fields, woodlands and areas of the old town of Haute-Nendaz. Spot the sculptures of Sofleu the Devil or Louvie the beast. Children can pick up a treasure maps at the tourist office and discover the ten sculptures along the path, each with their own story. Once the mission is complete head back to the tourist office for a reward.</p>
<h3>Bisse de Saxon</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Approx. 12.2km</li>
<li>Expect to take around three hours 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>After a day of marvelling at the mountain views at the top of the Mont-Fort, take the 12 kilometre walk back through the spruce forests back to Nendaz. This route follows the largest Bisse in the Valais region, going through the unique Dzerjonna rock fields, pretty meadows of Pra da Dzeu and spruce forests. The route begins at Siviez which can be reached by bus, follow the trail opposite the Les Bergers restaurant and turn right onto the bisse trail. The route ends in the old village of Haute Nendaz, it’s full of charm with old Valasian style buildings, the Saint-Michel chapel dating back to 1499 and the Tsâblo Mill. Be sure to have your cameras ready, there’s so many incredible photo opportunities along the way.</p>
<h3>Japanese garden</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Approx. 11km</li>
<li>Expect to take around three and a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the bus over to Siviez and follow the path towards Tortin, ramble through the mountain pastures towards Col des Gentianes, from here follow the signs to the Japanese Garden. The plateau, with streams and a zen-like appearance is reminiscent of a Japanese Garden – surprisingly, it's a natural area but it's so perfect that it gives the impression it's been landscaped.</p>
<h3>Lac du Grand Désert</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging walk</li>
<li>Approx. 15.8km</li>
<li>Expect to take at least five hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy breath-taking alpine landscapes along the ancient Bisse de Chervé - the highest bisse in the region. It joins the turquoise waters of the Cleuson lake to the mountain pastures of Thyon. Once you have reached the Cleuson dam, the turquoise water shines through amongst the rocky landscape. From here take the trail up towards the Grand Désert lake at 2,600 metres above sea level - it requires stamina, but the views are well worth it. On the way down follow the steep zig-zag path down below the dam and treat yourself to a bite to eat at one of the mountain huts.</p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Nendaz</h2>
<h3>Alpine village</h3>
<p>Nendaz is made up of fifteen villages and hamlets, each with their own distinctive features. Ramble through the charming Valasian style villages with traditional wooden buildings, enjoy fresh apricots and raspberries grown in the orchards, and enjoy the spectacular views of the Rhone Valley and the Printse river.</p>
<h3>Bisses</h3>
<p>The bisses were originally irrigation channels that diverted water from the rivers to water the pastures and farm land on the mountain slopes. There are eight bisses in Nendaz, six which still carry out the original task of irrigation, running through the alpine villages, apricot orchards, forests, pastures and meadows. The bisses make up for 98 kilometres of the walking routes, if you want to take the easier route explore the valley along the Bisse du Milieu - Bisse Vieux or take on the challenging route up the Bisse de Chervé, the highest alpine bisse in the region.</p>
<h3>The highest point in the Four Valleys</h3>
<p>Regardless of where you are in Nendaz, the view is amazing, however the best view of the Alps can be seen from the top of the Mont-Fort - especially at sunrise. It's 3,330 metres above sea level and overlooks some of Europe's most iconic mountains. Can you spot the Matterhorn or Mont Blanc?</p>
<p>Get the adrenaline pumping and fly down the highest zip line in the world. Take off above the Tortin glacier, between the Mont-Fort and the Col des Gentianes, and you’ll soon be whizzing down at speeds of 100 kilometres per hour down the 1.4km zipline.</p>
<h3>Raclette on the pasture</h3>
<p>Meet the iconic Hérens cows and enjoy delicious raclette prepared over a wood fire. Once a week you can immerse yourselves in Valasian traditions and take the chairlift up to Tortin, before walking through the forests and pastures. Spot the cows before heading to a clearing where you can devour this Swiss specialty. Book your spot through the tourist office on arrival for an unforgettable evening.</p>
<h3>Active adventures</h3>
<p>If you fancy a more active adventure hire a mountain bike or E-bike and explore the natural wonders of the Valais. There are 200 kilometres of mountain tracks to explore, cycle through the meadows and pastures, explore the villages of Nendaz or enjoy wonderful alpine views in the forest.</p>
<h3>Swimming and wellness</h3>
<p>Haute-Nendaz's ‘Chadèo’ outdoor swimming pool is the ideal spot to relax, heated to 25 degrees and with wonderful views of the Alps and the Rhone Valley, there is nowhere better for the whole family to unwind. For a little rest and rejuvenation, the Spa des Bisses (in the Hotel Nendaz Four Vallees) offers 2,200 square metres of pure relaxation in a space dedicated to water - there's even a bisse running through it. Take a dip in the outdoor pool, soak in the Jacuzzi, or enjoy feelings of weightlessness in the floatation pool. There's also saunas, a salt cave, an ice cave, counter-current pool and children's area.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Nendaz</h3>
<p>There’s over 250 kilometres of walking trails in Nendaz which cater for all abilities, whether you want to stroll through the pastures and enjoy lunch in the sun, or take on a challenging route to the Mont Fort, there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>Our favourite thing about walking in Nendaz is the variety of different trails – all with spectacular scenery. Walking along the bisses makes for a relaxed day.<br />Or, at 3,330 metres, the Mont Fort arguably has the best views over the Four Valleys. You can spot Mont Blanc and the infamous Matterhorn on a clear day. Take in the picturesque mountain peaks and wildflower meadows, there is somewhere new to explore each day.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
