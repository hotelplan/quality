  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Enjoy the lake views from the Panorama Trail on Mount Rigi</li>
<li>Take the short boat trip to explore the cultural city of Lucerne</li>
<li>Hire a kayak or paddleboard and take to the water, or enjoy a leisurely boat cruise</li>
</ul>
<p>Weggis lies on the northern shore of Lake Lucerne – the stomping ground of the rebellious Swiss folk hero William Tell. You’re more likely to find relaxation than revolution here these days. Visitors come for the peace, quiet, and lake-to-mountain views - it's a place where life is lived firmly in the slow lane and flower-lined promenades roll out around the water’s edge, ready for sunset strolls. However, that’s not to say you can’t choose to pick things up a bit. The hiking trails of Mount Rigi – AKA the Queen of the Mountains – crisscross the alpine slopes behind Weggis and lively Lucerne is just a 15-minute boat ride away.</p>
<h3>Mount Rigi: Queen of the Mountains</h3>
<p>Want to see if Mount Rigi lives up to its mighty nickname? Jump in the gondola from Weggis, which glides up to the mountain village of Rigi Kaltbad. Here, walks include a panoramic trail that follows the old railway line along the edge of the mountain. Or, you can continue climbing up Rigi by cog railway to explore more of the 120 kilometres of trails that are ready to explore on Mt. Rigi.</p>
<h3>Life on Lake Lucerne</h3>
<p>Embrace life on the lake by jumping aboard one of the paddle steamers that putter between the waterside towns of Lake Lucerne. Hop off in Bürgenstock for the luxury Alpine Spa or Alpnach for the steepest rack railway in the world which climbs up to Mount Pilatus. Stop in Lucerne to explore the city or take things more leisurely by settling in for lunch on a panoramic cruise. Prefer doing the paddling yourself? You can drift across the mirror-like blue waters on a paddle board or kayak, dipping into crystal-clear inlets and pocket-sized beaches en route.</p>
<h3>Mount Pilatus</h3>
<p>The spectacular Mount Pilatus sits across the water from Weggis, close to the city of Lucerne. Follow the Flower Trail along the sharp-edged ridgeline, it guides hikers through the array of alpine flowers that bloom here. There are family-friendly walks too (mountaintop scavenger hunt, anyone?), plus a rope park, dragon-themed zip line, barbecue spot and mountain playground. Panoramic gondolas and a cable car or the steep rack railway up mean the ascent is bound to be exciting - the really adventurous can choose to paraglide back down again.</p>
<h3>The lakeside city of Lucerne</h3>
<p>Lucerne city is just a 15-minute ferry ride across the lake. Don’t miss the iconic – and very photogenic – 14<sup>th</sup>-century wooden bridge in the Old Town or the Musegg Wall, with its nine spire-topped towers that you can climb for views over Lucerne and the lake beyond. Lucerne is also home to Switzerland’s most popular museum – the vast, family-friendly Museum of Transport, which showcases antique trains, planes and automobiles, as well as a planetarium.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Weggis has a great network of public transport and lifts that make getting around the area really easy. We recommend pre-booking a Tell Pass to help you make the most of exploring the area or you can use your included Swiss Half Fare Card to get up to 50% off most public transport, lifts, boat trips and scheduled cruises.</p>
<p>Please see the “Cards &amp; passes” tab for more information.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>Around Lake Lucerne you will find a variety of lifts and mountain railways, including unique open-top cableways and cogwheel trains to reach mid-stations and peaks. These are fantastic to use for accessing summit circulars, panoramic hikes, flower trails, themed paths, viewing platforms and so much more.</p>
<p>Often you will find routes that intertwine below the lifts, providing a great opportunity for a point-to-point ascent or descent where public transportation can assist in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The most popular mountain ranges around the lake accessible by a lift system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount Rigi</li>
<li>Mount Pilatus</li>
<li>Stanserhorn</li>
<li>Mount Stoos</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boats</h3>
<p>The lake has a fantastic fleet of boats and a selection of ports to travel to, meaning you can glide across the water to reach additional walking routes and mountain ranges. Lucerne is easy to access via a short boat journey. You can also opt for a leisurely lake cruise and even get lunch on board.</p>
<p>Popular ports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weggis</li>
<li>Lucerne</li>
<li>Brunnen</li>
<li>Vitznau</li>
<li>Fluelen</li>
<li>Küssnacht</li>
</ul>
<p>Lake Zug, just north of Weggis and Lake Lucerne, also has boat trips you can take. This is a separate lake which you can reach by bus, where even more lakeside walks, moderate hikes and challenging ascents await.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>There are lots of bus lines in and around Weggis, which will comfortably connect you to nearby villages, walking hotspots and the city of Lucerne.</p>
<p>Bus timetables and routes can be found online on the Weggis Vitznau Tourist Office website.</p>
<h3>Trains</h3>
<p>The closest train station to Weggis is Küssnacht am Rigi, which you can access via bus line 502 in around 15 minutes. From here you can take a train to the main station in Lucerne in around 20 minutes for any onward journeys.</p>
<p>In as little as two hours from Lucerne station you can reach Interlaken Ost, where you can travel further to explore the Jungfrau region. From here you can complete one of its many hikes available before returning on the same day.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <tagline><![CDATA[A summer holiday in Weggis is ideal spot for exploring the north shore of Lake Lucerne]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Weggis</h2>
<p>Weggis is surrounded by beautiful peaks, mountain excursions and plenty of on-lake activities. Located in the heart of Switzerland and renowned for its popularity, Lake Lucerne is a fantastic summer holiday destination for everyone.</p>
<h3>Walking for all abilities</h3>
<p>With a multitude of walking routes in Weggis and more from Rigi Kaltbad just a short gondola ride away, hiking in this region offers plenty to explore. If you are looking for a short route, then the five-kilometre Weggis circular walk takes you behind the village passing fruit-tree fields and beautiful meadows. For a trickier hike, try the Mark Twain Trail, spanning 10 kilometres and reaching 1,795 metres-altitude for a rewarding finish and great view.</p>
<h3>Cable Cars</h3>
<p>Soar above Lake Lucerne on panorama gondolas and aerial cableways to reach spectacular viewpoints and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. The cable car from Weggis will get you up to the great views from Rigi-Kaltbad in no time, and there's lovely walks to enjoy from the top. Or head to Lucerne and take the "Dragon Ride" cable car up to explore Mount Pilatus. Have you ever thought of an open-air cable car? The CabriO Cableway from Stans to Stanserhorn is just that. Stand on top of the cable car in this unique seven-minute experience.</p>
<h3>Cog-Wheel Railway</h3>
<p>Take a trip to Vitznau where you can get the cogwheel train in just under one hour to Rigi Kulm. Sit back and relax as you take in the beautiful scenery and experience Europe's first mountain railway for yourself. Or, ride the steepest cog railway in the world from Alpnach up to Mt. Pilatus, near Lucerne.</p>
<h3>Weggis Lido</h3>
<p>Swim, sunbath, dive, play, dine and relax at the Lido in Weggis. You have full access to changing rooms, equipment and toilets for a full day of lakeside living. With an on-site beach and volleyball court, this Swiss lake instantly turns into a whole new atmosphere - it even has a 25-metre indoor pool with Finnish steam bath and sauna.</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>Lake swimming is said to have natural healing properties as well as combining summer fun. Whether you're looking to dip your toes in to cool off, or go for a full lake swim, Weggis and its surrounding villages have you covered. Sunbath on the sandy beach at Vitznau's Brougier Park for ultimate relaxation with stunning Swiss mountain views.</p>
<h3>Water sports</h3>
<p>Grab your paddle and head towards the secluded beaches along the lake shore. In Weggis there are several options to hire a variety of water sports equipment locally. Want to sit back and soak up the sun on the lake? Hire a kayak. Fancy putting your balance to the test? Stand-up paddle boards are the way to go.</p>
<h3>Lake cruises</h3>
<p>Spend a relaxing day on the water through a lake cruise. Plenty of motorboats and steamboats operate on the lake, so there's endless options to choose from. Discover first-class service with an onboard dining experience like no other, or simply hop-on and hop-off to explore the surrounding villages and mountain peaks.</p>
<h3>Lakeside concerts and the best spot for sunset</h3>
<p>Relax and enjoy the music with regular concerts on the Weggis promenade and the lakeside pavilions in Weggis and nearby Vitznau. Enjoy calm evenings with great company, traditional &amp; cultural entertainment. The lakefront is the best spot for fabulous sunsets too – a perfect end to a perfect day.</p>
<h3>Visit Lucerne</h3>
<p>Take a boat ride to Lucerne - here foodies will be spoilt for choice with lots of restaurants and outdoor seating – ideal for sipping cocktails in the sun. Wander the Old Town, see the famous Chapel Bridge or head for Mount Pilatus and walk the flower trail.</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Immerse yourself in the culture of Lake Lucerne with the help of many art, history and panoramic museums within the region. We love the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne, where you can visit the gigantic road-sign building, learn all about the fantastic Swiss trains and see all the fun interactive exhibits.</span></p>
<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>Weggis is home to flat lakeside paths, perfect for easy rides whether it be a quick afternoon ride or scenic day trip to a nearby town. If you are more of a mountain-biker looking for a challenge, then Mount Rigi - Queen of the Mountains - is right behind Weggis. It's a biker's paradise and you can find mountain paths as well as intertwined forest routes.</p>
<h3>Festivals in Weggis</h3>
<p>The Heirassa folk music festival is often held over four days in June, bringing together lots of ensembles – making great entertainment paired with a traditional atmosphere to enjoy by the lake. In July the Rose festival brings together flower and food markets, live music and an incredible firework display.</p>
<h3>Swiss Army Knife making</h3>
<p>Assemble the famous Victorinox Swiss Army Knife under expert instruction in Fluelen, not far from Weggis. Your task is to put together 27 separate pieces with Swiss levels of precision. You then engrave your ‘Spartan’ knife which will be yours to take home. This model has been developed by the founder of Victorinox, Karl Elsener, and was legally trademarked on 12 June 1897.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps and apps</h3>
<p>For Weggis we recommend Kompass Map number 116, which has a scale of 1:25,000 / 1:35,000 or 1:50,000. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. You can often find these from the hotel reception area too. </p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Weggis</h3>
<p>The beautiful mountain walking area of Rigi behind Weggis and Vitznau is a must for all keen walkers. With over 120km of well-marked trails, you will be covered if you're a leisurely walker, or a daring hiker looking for a challenge. You also have great public transport connections allowing you to explore other mountain ranges around the lake like Mount Pilatus – so it's time to get those laces tied and head outside.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>The local Weggis/ Vitznau tourist office runs an attractive programme of guided walks and days out all season (payable locally).</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
