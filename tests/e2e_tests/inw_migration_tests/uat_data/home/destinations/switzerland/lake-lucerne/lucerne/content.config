  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Stroll the frescoed streets of the historic Old Town and see Chapel Bridge</li>
<li>Make the Golden Round Trip to Mount Pilatus via panoramic cable-car, rack-railway and boat </li>
<li>Embrace the lakeside setting with a scenic boat cruise to Weggis and trip up Mount Rigi</li>
</ul>
<p>The picturesque city of Lucerne is poised on the banks of one of Switzerland’s largest lakes – the sprawling <a data-udi="umb://document/70b1a325037e4112bc5e6feeb41d725f" href="/{localLink:umb://document/70b1a325037e4112bc5e6feeb41d725f}" title="Lake Lucerne">Lake Lucerne</a>. It’s a locale that’s inspired royalty, poets and composers, who have all gathered here, leading to a boom in grand hotels and villas. Lucerne is an incredibly walkable city of barely 250,000 residents, with streets leading past frescoed cafés and museums in the car-free Old Town. Just don’t forget the world beyond while on your wanders. Polished paddle steamers leave Lucerne bound for villages like <a data-udi="umb://document/e67e0510aeab481fa844cb74e63612a6" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e67e0510aeab481fa844cb74e63612a6}" title="Weggis">Weggis</a> and Vitznau, and the local mountains of Rigi and Pilatus Kulm are adorned with exceptional hiking trails.</p>
<h3>Here there be dragons: Mount Pilatus</h3>
<p>Local people once believed that dragons lived in the caves and crannies of Mount Pilatus. And if you look closely, the set of peaks <em>does</em> look like a dragon spine reclining on the edge of Lucerne. The dragon theme continues on the mountaintop with scavenger hunts, storied trails and kid-friendly zip lines. There are also footpaths like the Flower Trail, and forest tracks and alpine moors, as well as climbs for experienced mountaineers. You can get to Pilatus by gondola and cable car starting in Kriens – or from the village of Alpnach for a ride on the steepest rack railway in the world - you can do it all with the Golden Round Trip which includes a boat trip between Alpnach and Lucerne.</p>
<h3>Lake Lucerne</h3>
<p>Ferries and historic paddle steamers carry passengers around the many-armed Lake Lucerne, stopping at the small ports that decorate the shores. Hop off at the pretty town of Weggis for Mount Rigi - nicknamed Queen of the Mountains - it's a hiking paradise with 120 kilometres of varied walking trails to explore and lake views to enjoy. Alternatively, book onto a lunch cruise, pick up a paddle board to explore the water at your own pace, or for a day of ultimate luxury, book a trip to the Bürgenstock Alpine Spa.</p>
<h3>Lucerne: the city of bridges</h3>
<p>Lucerne is one of the most walkable cities in Switzerland. Highlights include the much-loved Chapel Bridge that reaches over the River Reuss, the old city walls, the villa museum dedicated to Wagner, and the Church of St Leodegar, which sits its gothic spires on the site of an old Roman basilica. Need a breather? Take your pick of waterside bars and restaurants for a fruit brandy in view of the mountains, alfresco dining is a bit of a theme in Lucerne. “En guete!” as they say in the Alemannic dialect spoken here.</p>
<h3>Getting around Lucerne – and beyond</h3>
<p>Trolleybuses trundle around Lucerne’s city streets, while motor buses head into the hilly suburbs and villages beyond the city limits, and a funicular hoists view seekers up to Château Gütsch, the fairy-tale hotel perched above Lucerne. Meanwhile, the railway station is the gateway to big-name Swiss cities such as Zurich and ferries and paddle steamers bob at the quay next to the station - you can't come to Lucerne and not head out onto the water.</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Lucerne</h2>
<h3>Activities on Mount Pilatus</h3>
<p>Explore PILU-land with the children - a mythical-beast-themed play area where kids can burn as much energy as they like running freely, testing their balancing skills, speeding down the slide or scrambling over the wooden climbing frames. You’ll also be able to have a barbeque here too, so no one will go hungry.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in an interactive experience at Dragon World. If the weather isn't playing ball, then encounter the virtual dragons through the interactive games and visual effects.</p>
<p>Are you an adventurous family seeking an adrenaline rush? The PILU Rope Park is exceptional and will not disappoint. Join the mountain dragon on the treetop adventure – fit for children aged four and above. If you have daring teens and want more of a challenge, then the higher ropes course is incredible. Who will take on the obstacles first?</p>
<h3>Europe's tallest outdoor elevator</h3>
<p>Brave the mountain edge cliff walk at the bottom before you start your thrilling ascent up the Hammetschwant Lift, renowned for being the highest outdoor lift in Europe. As you are taken up to 1,132 metres high, a whole new point of view is unlocked – so make sure to have your camera ready.</p>
<h3>Klewenalp flower trail</h3>
<p>Play a game of I-spy surrounded by up to 120 different flower species. Enjoy a leisurely stroll along the three-kilometre circular trail – it's suitable for prams as well. Starting with an exciting hour-and-a-half lake cruise to Beckenried, you’ll then need to take the cable car to the Klewenalp mountain station to start the nature hunt.</p>
<h3>Mount Rigi playgrounds</h3>
<p>Play areas on Mount Rigi are fantastic. You can use the Swiss Half Fare Card to cross the lake at a reduced rate, where plenty of playgrounds can be found. Take a trip to Rigiland Adventure, Rigi Burggeist, Rigi Scheidegg playground, or visit them all. What more could a child want than a day of playground hopping.</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>Lucerne has a great network of public transport and lifts that make getting around the area really easy.</p>
<p>We recommend pre-booking a Tell Pass to help you make the most of exploring the area or you can use your included Swiss Half Fare Card to get up to 50% off most public transport, lifts, boat trips and scheduled cruises.</p>
<p>Please see the “Cards &amp; passes” tab for more information.</p>
<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>Around Lake Lucerne you will find a variety of lifts and mountain railways, including unique open-top cableways and cogwheel trains to reach mid-stations and peaks. These are fantastic to use for accessing summit circulars, panoramic hikes, flower trails, themed paths, viewing platforms and so much more.</p>
<p>Often you will find routes that intertwine below the lifts, providing a great opportunity for a point-to-point ascent or descent where public transportation can assist in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The most popular mountain ranges around the lake accessible by a lift system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount Rigi</li>
<li>Mount Pilatus</li>
<li>Stanserhorn</li>
<li>Mount Stoos</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trains</h3>
<p>Lucerne station is a major hub for the Swiss rail network. From here you can catch the panoramic train Lucerne Interlaken Express. There are multiple stations around the lake which can be reached from here too, making it super easy to transport to local walking areas.</p>
<p>With your included Lucerne Visitors Card, provided to you by your hotel, you can access free use of second-class trains within zone 10.</p>
<h3>Boats</h3>
<p>The lake has a fantastic fleet of boats and a selection of ports to travel to, meaning you can glide across the water to reach additional walking routes and mountain ranges.</p>
<p>These popular ports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucerne</li>
<li>Weggis</li>
<li>Brunnen</li>
<li>Vitznau</li>
<li>Fluelen</li>
<li>Küssnacht</li>
</ul>
<p>Lake Zug, north-east of Lucerne city, also has boat trips you can take. This is a separate lake which you can reach by bus or train, where even more lakeside walks, moderate hikes and challenging ascents await.</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>Lucerne city has an extensive public transport network, with set bus lines and many stops on each route. Not only do buses operate in and around the city, but also to lift stations, ideal for getting you from your city hotel to the mountain bases – ready for a day of adventure.</p>
<p>Using your included Lucerne Visitors Card, you can access unlimited free buses within zone 10.</p>
<p>Bus timetables and routes can be found online on the Lucerne Tourist Office website, or at the information points around the city.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Flower path from Pilatus-Kulm to the Tomlishorn</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy to moderate walk</li>
<li>3.1km</li>
<li>Expect to take one to two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the beautiful flowers and thriving alpine world along this high altitude walk, starting from the Pilatus-Kulm summit station. You’ll experience two summits at either end of the trail, with only a 60-metre height difference. The colourful trail is supported by information boards, so a wonderful experience for keen botanists too.</p>
<h3>Lucerne sightseeing tour</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>4.2km</li>
<li>Expect to take around two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Walking doesn't have to just be on the mountains. Tour the city as you go between famous monuments, over the Chapel bridge, see the Jesuit Church, through the Old City Square and so much more. With countless narrow streets and a picturesque promenade, there is always the option to detour to increase the historical building sights on your checklist.</p>
<h3>Stanserhorn summit hike</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>7.8km</li>
<li>Expect to take four to five hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Head up the Stanserhorn from Stans, as you wind your way up to the summit just below the cableway. Feel accomplished at the top with incredible views and an amazing viewing platform with panoramic sights. With sharp bends and steep inclines, you can view your footpath from above as you catch a lift back down.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Lucerne</h2>
<h3>Lucerne's famous Old Town</h3>
<p>Along the River Reuss that joins Lake Lucerne, located between City Hall and Chapel Bridge stands the stunning waterfront row of local restaurants and cafés, perfect for daytime treats or evening cuisine. This postcard-perfect strip has beautifully decorated buildings and flower covered balconies.</p>
<h3>Cultural and historical experiences</h3>
<p>Stroll down the cobbled streets in Lucerne's Old Town as you travel back in time along the beautiful facades. Book a guided city tour or visit the famous Lion monument, a popular landmark in one of the central parks. Pop into the churches to admire stunning interiors, and purchase a museum pass to immerse yourself in the local history and culture.</p>
<h3>Shopping and markets</h3>
<p>Lucerne is home to many markets and charming boutiques. The colourful Wochenmarkt is held once or twice a week and is full of fresh fruit, vegetables and local cheeses. Other fresh food and drink markets include the Markthalle Luzern and the fish market. And, once a month there is also a craft market and the Monatsmarkt, perfect for collecting memorable souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Music Festivals</h3>
<p>The ‘Blue Balls’ music and arts festival has some free concerts (approx. 19 - 27 Jul) covering a range of genres and artists. If you are more into classical music, then the International Music Festival (approx. 16 Aug - 15 Sep) is one of the world leading series that has been going since 1938.</p>
<h3>Beaches around the lake</h3>
<p>Take a visit to Ufschötti, a small swimming beach easily walkable from Lucerne main station. With a reasonable sized lawn you can enjoy a picnic, game of beach volleyball, or lay back and soak up the sun before taking a dip in the lake or tucking into an ice cream. There's plenty of other lakeside lidos to discover too.</p>
<h3>Water sports</h3>
<p>Glide over the mirrored waters on a kayak, make your way to a nearby village on a stand-up paddle board, sail across the waterway or challenge yourself to some intense wakeboarding. Lake Lucerne is fantastic for its watersport activities, so why not gear up and try something new.</p>
<h3>Lake cruises</h3>
<p>Hop on one of the steamboats or motorboats and discover the region in no time. With first-class service and onboard dining, the options to choose from and experiences up for grabs are endless. We love the Golden Round Trip from Lucerne, combining a lake cruise with mountain transport to explore Mt. Pilatus. You can even get a discounted fee on the cruises with your included Swiss Half Fare Card.</p>
<h3>Mountain Peak day trips</h3>
<p>Mount Rigi, Bürgenstock, and Pilatus Kulm surround Lake lucerne. You can reach Mt. Pilatus’ peak by the steepest cogwheel railway in the world or travel by mountain railway, boat and cableway on the Mt. Pilatus Golden Round Trip circular route. Or, head to Weggis and take a trip to Mt. Rigi, "Queen of the Mountains" for some spectacular views. There is also good scope for walking and even cycling on many of these local mountains.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps and apps</h3>
<p>For Lucerne we recommend Kompass Map number 116, which has a scale of 1:25,000 / 1:35,000 or 1:50,000. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. You can often find these from the hotel reception area too. </p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Lucerne</h3>
<p>Lucerne is a fantastic city to explore, as well as being right on the doorstep of some of Switzerland's most popular summits. Head to the top of Mount Pilatus for incredible views and some imprevice lifts and mountain railways. Or, take a visit to Mount Rigi, "Queen of the Mountains", where there's 120 kilometres of walking trails ready to explore. With the help of mountain railways, gondolas, boats, and buses, you can create unforgettable memories walking down low along the promenade, or up high along mountain ridges.</p>
<h3>Guided walks</h3>
<p>You can go on a guided tour of the city, walking past the highlights with a local expert. These can be arranged locally with the help of the Tourist Office at the local information centre.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
