  <description><![CDATA[<p>Montreux sits on the north-east shore of Lake Geneva, between bright blue waters and the forested foothills of the Alps. Visitors have long been drawn to the mild climes here – from the monks who first planted the Lavaux vineyards to the well-heeled tourists and rock stars who have stayed in the belle époque mansions and stylish hotels. Trains climb into the mountains, exploring food routes and heading up to high alpine footpaths and viewpoints. The mild climate also fuels the food and drink scene; the whole Montreux Riviera is famous for its wine and cuisine.</p>
<h3>Strolling the Montreux Riviera</h3>
<p>A promenade runs along the shore of Lake Geneva, sweeping south from Montreux to the town of Villeneuve via the medieval towers of the charming Château de Chillon. Look out for Freddie Mercury while walking the prom; Queen recorded six albums in the Mountain Studios in Montreux, along with fellow rockers Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and David Bowie. If music is your thing, time your visit for the summer Montreux Jazz Festival (around 5-20 July 2024).</p>
<h3>Lake Geneva</h3>
<p>Geneva is the largest lake in Switzerland – and one of the best ways to explore it is by boat. Ferries and paddle steamers cruise between the villages, towns and cities that dot the shores. With a day pass in hand, you can hop on and off wherever you fancy (we recommend Vevey for museums and galleries or Lausanne for its café culture and the Olympic Museum). To see the lake from above, head up the Rochers de Naye cog railway from Montreux - there's views for miles and plenty of exciting walking trails to discover.</p>
<h3>The Lavaux vineyards</h3>
<p>The Lavaux vineyards were founded by the monasteries that ruled these parts back in the 11th Century. With sunny, sheltered terraces that dip down towards the waters of Lake Geneva, the Lavaux must be one of the prettiest winemaking regions in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning around 800 hectares, it has some of the loveliest walking territory too, including the 11 kilometre-long Terrasses de Lavaux hiking trail. Back in Montreux, you can sip a glass of Lavaux-grown Chasselas with a plate of fresh fish or platter of peppery le petit chaude cheese.</p>
<h3>Trains and trails or cheese and chocolate?</h3>
<p>You can take your pick of train stations in Montreux, which is home to the scenic trans-Alpine Simplon railway line. A cog railway also runs up to the viewpoint at Rochers de Naye. From here, you can embark on the final part of the Via Alpina long-distance walking trail, which runs back down to Montreux, or wander the Alpine garden. Alternatively, embark on a typically Swiss culinary day out and hop aboard the Chocolate Train which runs from Montreux. The belle époque-style carriages trundle through vineyards and mountain meadows, to Montbovon where the Chocolate bus takes over, taking you first to the medieval village of Gruyères - famous for its cheese - and on to the village of Broc and the <span>Cailler-Nestlé chocolate factory.</span></p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Montreux with Inghams?</h2>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Montreux</h2>
<h3>Marmotte Paradise observation area</h3>
<p>View Lake Geneva from new heights as you make your way up the Rochers-de-Naye by rack railway. There is even a “Marmottes Paradise” themed coach, so keep your eyes peeled and count how many marmots you can spot – they love soaking up the sun and being cheeky - just like your little ones.</p>
<h3>Glacier 3000</h3>
<p>Take a journey up to the glacier where the whole family can brave the peak walk by Tissot suspension bridge, or zoom down the alpine coaster at the funpark. This is also an exceptional place for family photos, with an incredible ice capped backdrop – even in the summer months.</p>
<h3>Swiss Chocolate Train</h3>
<p>Pack your bags and set off for a full day culinary trip. This experience will have you all seeing, smelling and most importantly tasting the world-famous Swiss chocolate. Starting in Montreux, going to Broc and then returning, you will visit the Cailler-Nestlé chocolate factory and “La Maison du Gruyère” show dairy where they produce famous Swiss cheese.</p>
<h3>Water sports on Lake Geneva</h3>
<p>Head down to one of the public swimming areas for a dip in the lake. Or, increase the fun by renting water sport equipment like stand-up paddle boards or canoes. Have a family race, or if you have teens looking for real speed, let them try wakeboarding.</p>
<h3>Aquaparc</h3>
<p>This family fun spot close to Montreux has lots of fast flumes, rubber raft rides and family slides. There is also a kiddie section called “Sharkyland,” with their own suitable slides and paddle pool. This waterpark also has a large splash lagoon, wave pool and outdoor lazy river – perfect for all ages.</p>
<h3>Scenic boat trips</h3>
<p>Take a seat on one of the boats as you take a round trips on Lake Geneva. Perhaps a game of eye-spy would be good, where you can point out Chillon Castle or the nature reserve Les Grangettes. Considering how large the lake is, you have lots of opportunities of routes – so why not hop and off rather than go on a full round tour.</p>
<h3>Explore Geneva</h3>
<p>If you love a shopping spree, head to the city of Geneva by train, located on the other end of the lake. From giant indoor department stores to boutique cobbled street shops, there is something for everyone. Or, let them go round spotting landmarks like the Jet d’Eau.</p>]]></festivals>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>Montreux Riviera promenade</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>6km</li>
<li>Expect to take one to two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Soak up the sun as you stroll alongside the lake shore. Visit the beautiful old town of Villeneuve, another place to explore after passing Switzerland's most visited historic building – the Chateau Chillon. <span>For a short extension, carry on from Villeneuve and take the short walk (approx. 15 minutes) along the shore to Le Bouveret to admire the various plants and wildlife, including over 270 species of bird, which can be found here.</span></p>
<h3>Chemin des Narcisses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>6km</li>
<li>Expect to take around two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>View Lake Geneva from above as you complete this circular nature walk from Les Avants. Pass through stunning meadows with daffodils and fresh alpine forests with lots of wildlife. Take a short break on the trail bench, providing the best views facing the Dents du Midi, a three-kilometres mountain range in the distance.</p>
<h3>Rochers-de-Naye to Montreux</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>13.2km</li>
<li>Expect to take around four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>After catching the cogwheel railway up the mountain, make your way back down to Montreux on foot, a scenic route passing over the sandstone cliff trail and along steep ridges. This mountain is known as the home of marmots, so keep your eyes peeled for some friendly faces along the way. Before making the descent, you can visit <span>‘La Rambertia’ alpine garden at the summit of the Rochers de Naye where there are 1,000 alpine plants and great views of the lake.</span></p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Montreux</h2>
<h3>Walking in Montreux</h3>
<p>With nearby alpine gardens, vineyards and nature reserves, Montreux makes for a fantastic walking destination – perfect for beginner hikers and leisurely strollers. A less challenging walk is the Gorges du Chauderon, coming across beautiful greenery in under three miles, with easily accessible paths. Or, if you are wanting to test your fitness, there are also routes like the “Dent de Jaman” to the summit of Rochers de Naye starting in Haux-de-Caux, a circular with rewarding views of Lake Geneva.</p>
<h3>Leisurely cycling and mountain biking</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a scenic bike ride, right? The beautiful lakeside promenade lined with palm trees and flowers can be explored even further by bike. Take a gentle ride to nearby villages such as Clarens and Veytaux for picture-perfect views with refreshment breaks along the way. More of a mountain biker? Then the 29-kilometre Montreux Panorama circular trail will have you winding through forests, riding over rolling hills and speeding down tracks to Bains de l'Alliaz.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing and shopping</h3>
<p>Montreux has excellent train, bus and boat links to the Swiss cities and towns of Geneva, Lausanne, Morges, Vevey and Nyon; as well as the French towns of Évian-les-Bains, Yvoire, Thonon-les-Bains and Saint-Gingolph. This is a wonderful base to explore the region, with lots of places to visit – perfect for day trips around Lake Geneva. Alternatively, take the little mountain train up to Rochers de Naye, one of Switzerland's favourite viewpoints.</p>
<h3>Lake cruises</h3>
<p>Hop on a charming lake steamer or ferry as you set sail to nearby towns and villages. Or, take a round trip. The scenic cruises will have you landing in Evian, Lausanne and other pretty destinations to explore further by foot. Glide over the clear waters as you travel past Chillon Castle, alongside the Swiss and French Alps on the two-hour Montreux Riviera cruise by paddle-steamer.</p>
<h3>Château de Chillon</h3>
<p>Visit the famous 12th Century castle, located on a rock on Lake Geneva's banks – something quite spectacular. The museum inside is incredible for the whole family, and has amazing views over Lake Geneva. Or, visit the nearby Fort de Chillon in Veytaux – an interactive military museum.</p>
<h3>History and culture museums</h3>
<p>You can explore the three museums of centre of Montreux, being the Musée de Montreux, Centre Culturel Maison Visinand, and Queen: The Studio Experience. Not only this, but you have endless other museums around the lake, which you can get to at a reduced rate using your Swiss Half Fare Card. Sports lovers, head to Lausanne and visit the impressive Olympic Museum.</p>
<h3>Visit Vevey</h3>
<p>Visit the old town of Vevey, with its cobbled streets, little shops and local history museum. You can also go to “Chaplin’s world,” the Charlie Chaplin interactive museum. On Saturdays from July to September, there are folk markets that take place in Vevey – ideal for snapping up some souvenirs and local products.</p>
<h3>Lavaux Vineyards - a UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
<p>Take a trip to the staggered vineyards in Lavaux where you can taste some of the 300 regional wines. Discover the UNESCO world heritage site – where you will go on a beautiful vine grower stroll before tasting the fresh products back inside. Maybe you will find your new favourite wine.</p>
<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
<p>Head up the surrounding mountains to beautiful gardens and flower trails. Or, make your way down to Villeneuve, where ‘Les Grangettes’ nature reserve is an internationally recognised hotspot for songbirds, natural habitats and home to over 250 species. There are even beavers here too – will you spot one?</p>
<h3>Water sports</h3>
<p>You can pick up a paddle board, canoe and other water sport equipment at local hire shops, perfect for cooling off on the lake. If your feeling daring, then there are also opportunities to try more advanced water sports like wakeboarding, water skiing and rubber dinghy and banana boat rides.</p>
<h3>Festivals and events</h3>
<ul>
<li>Montreux Jazz festival with live music (approx. 5 - 20 Jul)</li>
<li>‘September Musical’ classical music festival</li>
<li>Street Artists festival with free shows in Vevey</li>

<p>Suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, rain jacket, sun cream, insect repellent, sun glasses, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a re-usable water bottle, a snack and cash. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>For Montreux we recommend picking up a walking map from the tourist office or downloading one digitally online from the Montreux Riviera website. Maps will have a key to help you understand the nature of the walk before you begin. You can often find these from the hotel reception area too. </p>
<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Swiss Emergency Services: 144</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Montreux</h3>
<p>With around 100 kilometres of walking paths there are plenty of opportunities in and around Montreux, for pleasant lakeside strolls or longer walks in the hills above the town. There are several walks which meander through the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the terraced Lavaux vineyards, which stretch along the shores of Lake Geneva. Not only this, but you also have quick and easy access to walking in France on the south side of Lake Geneva too.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
