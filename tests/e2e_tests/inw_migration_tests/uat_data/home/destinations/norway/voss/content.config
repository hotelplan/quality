  <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that athletes from Voss have won more medals per capita than anywhere else in world? Spend a week or two here, and it’s easy to see why. By summer, this ski resort has well and truly shed its snowy winter coat, revealing crashing waterfalls and mountains that inspire you to get up and go – go hiking, biking or any one of the other many adventures you can embark on here. Plus, in Voss, part of the excitement is getting from A to B, whether that’s on the high-rise train to Flam or the panoramic cable car to mountain trails.</p>
<h2>Gondolas and gorges</h2>
<p>There’s so much to do in Voss – so where to start? Our recommendation: at the village centre cable car that climbs up Mount Hanguren. Less than 10 minutes later, you’ll be delivered to a restaurant and footpaths that range from easy to exceedingly challenging, there are plenty walking routes to suit everyone. They all have a few things in common, though: incredible views over glaciers, lakes, mountains and fjords.</p>
<h2>Extremely exciting summer adventures</h2>
<p>Voss hosts the extreme sports festival Ekstremsportveko for one week every June. But you don’t have to be an athlete to launch yourself into these landscapes, take on some of the local walking trails by yourself or check out our excursions that include challenging hikes with expert guides. These are settings that have inspired local people to become world champions in mountain sports.</p>
<h2>Inspire the next generation of adventurers</h2>
<p>Voss is great for families. There are pump tracks for cycling and skating, rivers for rafting, and a wind tunnel that gives you the chance to see what skydiving feels like without leaping from a plane. There’s a climbing park too – and, because this is Voss, it comes with a zipline. Voss Folk Museum offers a pocket of calm, as well as insight into the lives of farming communities that have lived here since well before tourism took off in the 1920s.</p>
<h2>Easy summer day trips</h2>
<p>If you haven’t had your fill of fantastic scenery yet, then never fear – there’s far more to see. Take the train east to Myrdal mountain station, where you can change onto the famously scenic Flam Railway. Or go west to Bergen, home to museums, art galleries, a fish market, and a historic wooden wharf. The fjords are in reach too, from Flam or one of the many other villages that can be accessed by the buses and railways that weave around the mountains.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Voss with Inghams?</h2>
<p>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Voss include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Norway's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>]]></description>

  <tagline><![CDATA[An action-packed town with an adventurous spirit – Voss is for those who are ready to dive into summer in the mountains]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Culture and History</h3>
<p>For a stroll down Voss’s memory lane then maybe try out The Bergsliloypa (The Bergsli-Trail). It’s a cultural walk that takes you past several locations that had historical significance to the Bergslien family that were made up of three artists and sculptors. The Bergslien artists lived in Voss during the 19th century and today you’ll find most of their work is in Oslo. This walk begins at the church where you’ll see a monument with three reliefs depicting the artists. Follow the route, stroll along the lake and pass by the Berglitraeet where two of the family members grew up – this is now a little museum that opens on selected days during the summer (usually open on a Sunday).</p>
<p>If you’re wishing to learn a bit more about what life was like centuries ago in Voss, then the Voss Folke Museum has a permanent exhibition in place. It’s set in a beautiful location across several historic buildings that you can wander around at your leisure.</p>
<h3>An active town</h3>
<p>There’s plenty to keep you busy when you’re in Voss with a bunch of activities on offer that kids and adults will love.</p>
<p>The bowling and activity centre has eight bowling lanes, two pool tables as well as a great play area for kids. Or, head to the Vossabadet Indoor Swimming Centre which has an exercise pool and a family friendly pool, it’s great for cooling off on warmer days.</p>
<p>For epic views and a great day out, you can head up in the gondola. Once at the top you can wander some of the walking trails, dine in the restaurant or simply admire the views.</p>
<p>If you’re wanting to get a little further afield then there are several local bike trails to explore. Go in search of waterfalls or lakes.</p>
<h3>Flam Railway</h3>
<p>The Flam Railway is often referred to as one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world. It departs from Myrdal and journeys to Flam, which is around 20 kilometres away. Skirt through the Flam valley, keep your eyes peeled for distant waterfalls and dramatic mountains.</p>
<p>Riding the Flam railway is a must for many visitors coming to this part of Norway so you’ll need to book tickets far in advance and there’s no seat allocation so if you’re hoping to bag a seat, make sure you arrive with plenty of time to board the train. From Voss, the best way to do the journey is to catch a train to Myrdal where the Flam Railway departs and do a return journey. </p>
<h3>Journey outside of Voss</h3>
<p>Whether you’re looking to head to the famous village of Flam and spend the day admiring the views or, head to the city of Bergen for plenty of sightseeing, Voss puts you in a great position to explore the area. There are numerous train routes to get you to different destinations or, you may wish to book onto one of our excursions (see the excursions section below for more information).</p>
<p>Gudvangen takes around an hour and thirty minutes to get to by bus from Voss. It sits right at the entrance to the Nærøyfjord, so you won’t be disappointed by the views. What makes this village so unique though is its Viking heritage which has led to a reconstruction of a Viking settlement, called The Viking Village – there are often exhibits with workshops and sometimes performances taking place. You may wish to purchase tickets in advance as it can be a popular attraction during high season.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to explore further on from Gudvangen then you can always book onto a Fjord cruise that takes you through the Naeroyfjord and journey to Flam. From Flam you can catch the flam railway to Myrdal where you can catch a train back to Voss (this journey must be booked in advance as flam railway tickets can sell out months in advance).</p>
<h3>Skjervefossen waterfall</h3>
<p>The Skjervefossen waterfall is around a 20 minutes bus from Voss (bus routes are subject to local schedules and changes, make sure you plan your journey), with around a 40 minute walk (one way) from the bus stop to the waterfall. This powerful waterfall has water flowing through it from a height of 150 metres, there are several rest areas – perfect for a picnic, just make sure you take food and drink with you as there’s nowhere to purchase any once you leave Voss.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>Ekstremsportveko Festival - This festival is usually held annually at the end of June (check event dates prior to booking, you’ll need to purchase tickets to attend this event and they can sell out fast so it’s best to book in advance). It’s the largest extreme sport festival in the world, you’ll get to see national and international athletes do everything from kayaking, paragliding, skydiving, skateboarding, rafting and many more. During this time Voss has a great energy with lots of people flocking to this mountain town especially for the event.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in Voss</h3>
<p>Voss is fantastic for those wanting to be active on holiday. Voss itself is known for all the sporting activities it has on offer, including walking. You’ve got some lower level walks in the valley and around the lakes or head into the surrounding hills and mountains for more of a challenge. You’re also situated in a great location to access more of the local area. With train and bus connections heading east and west, it’s easy to get out and explore. Whether you decide to head west for Bergen or east for Flam, you’re in for some great walking.</p>
