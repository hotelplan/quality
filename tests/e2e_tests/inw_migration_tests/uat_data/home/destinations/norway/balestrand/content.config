  <description><![CDATA[<p>Balestrand might be small, but its position is mighty – sitting on the northern shore of Sognefjord, the longest and deepest fjord in Norway. The mountain vistas and dreamy light have drawn artists since the 19th century, when they set up an artist’s colony of Romantic dragon-style villas. On a walking holiday in Balestrand you can also take inspiration amongst the many footpaths around Balestrand, from family-friendly nature trails to summit scrambles. There’s a port too; jump on a ferry or boat trip to explore the fjord.</p>
<h3>Walking Holidays in Balestrand: From nature trails to spectacular summits</h3>
<p>You can take your pick of walking paths on a Balestrand holiday. Meander through farmland and forests to nature trails and picnic spots. Or follow the water’s edge between sandy shell-shaped beaches and benches strategically placed for marvelling at the mountains. After a challenge? Reach for the steep hikes to sky-scraping summits.</p>
<h3>A little village with a lot going on</h3>
<p>Balestrand is barely a kilometre across, gathering a small selection of cafés, restaurants, boutiques and art galleries within a 20-minute walk of each other. <a data-udi="umb://document/d26dcba440054402b9ccfe7166c1ad56" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d26dcba440054402b9ccfe7166c1ad56}" title="Kviknes Hotel">Kviknes Hotel</a> is the showstopper – a grand Swiss-style hotel that has been run by the same family since 1877. St. Olaf’s Church is another architectural treasure. A Romantic recreation of a medieval stave church, it looks more like a Viking ship rising between the villas around. The Norwegian Museum of Travel and Tourism explains all about the history of hospitality here. Mull over everything from the café with widescreen views of Sognefjord.</p>
<h3>The fjords are your oyster</h3>
<p>Summer holidays in Balestrand are made for exploring. Boats and ferries depart from the harbour and journey through the Sognefjord. The village of Flam is less than a two-hour (and very pretty) boat ride away, there is usually only one departure per day so be sure to plan your return journey before travelling. A popular cruise ship stop and the beginning of the Flam Railway, it also lays out footpaths that wind between fjords, waterfalls, wooden churches and eagle’s-eye viewpoints. Back in Balestrand, there’s the option to explore the fjords on your own schedule by kayak or bike.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nature Trail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Takes approx. 2 – 4 hours depending on the route you choose</li>
<li>Difficulty: Easy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great walk for anyone after an easier path with plenty of interest, you pass by information points that give details on the local wildlife - it's great to pick up some local knowledge. The trail is around 50 cm wide and is mainly stone, gravel or grass and as you continue on the walk you’ll get some great views towards Balestrand.</p>
<p><strong>Raudmelen (50-972 masl) i Balestrand</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duration: Approx. 6 hours</li>
<li>Difficulty: Challenging</li>
</ul>
<p>This demanding hike begins just on the edge of Balestrand and you’ll climb to the top of Raudmelen where you’ll be greeted by fantastic views over the Sognefjord. There are steep and narrow parts to the walk.</p>
<p><strong>Orrabenken</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: Moderate</li>
<li>Ascent: Approx. 370 metres</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of different routes you can take for this one so it’s best to chat to the Kviknes hotel first to decide which route is best for you. Depending on the route you take, it can be challenging in places but the views are spectacular.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Retreat into nature</h3>
<p>Being a small village, Balestrand’s activities tend to be more focused on it’s location. It’s about taking the time to enjoy the scenery and explore this area within the fjords. Wander to Gamleheimsfjøra to sit by the shores of the fjord or get into the mountains on foot for views from above. You may also wish to do a day trip so you get to see more of the area, this includes trips by boat so you get to be out on those fjord waters – see our excursion tab for more information.</p>
<h3>Sognefjord: the cider fjord</h3>
<p>The green sweep of Sognefjord is farming country – and apples are the speciality. You’ll see cider varieties all over the menus in Balestrand. For the best experience, go right to the source, where the town orchard and cider house serves juice, wine and brandy, as well as tasting tours. Elsewhere, you can dine well on regional specials like salmon, dumplings and (of course) apple pie.</p>
<h3>Look out for unique architecture</h3>
<p>There are some unique buildings on these shores often referred to as being built in the “Swiss style”. The Hotel Kviknes is one of these buildings and is a statement on Balestrands shores. Another building to keep an eye out for is St. Olaf’s Church which was built in 1897, its a small church and is said to belong to the Church of England.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Travel Museum</h3>
<p>This museum is just next door to the Kviknes hotel and great to wander. It details the history of travel and tourism and shows how tourism has developed in Norway. You can also purchase tickets for guided tours or pop into their little cafe.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>In May, Balestrand is often host to a Jazz festival, this takes place over a couple of days and is a great celebration of Jazz music and generally brings more people into Balestrand. The festival dates vary year to year so if you're interested in attending be sure to check the festival dates prior to booking (tickets may also need to be purchased in advance).</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Walking Guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains, lakes and fjords are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help them stay that way, and remain enjoyable and safe places for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>

<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Balestrand</h3>
<p>Being right on the Sognefjord means you’re in for a treat when it comes to hiking in Balestrand. There are some great walking trails on offer that are well-marked and most offer fantastic views. You’ll find walks to suit a range of abilities, however with the mountains surrounding the fjords, it does lend itself to be a slightly more challenging area for hiking. We love to spend a few days hiking here, just for those epic panoramas and peaceful trails.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
