  <description><![CDATA[<p>Head west, and you’ll find Bergen set snugly between the ocean, mountains and two of Norway’s biggest fjords. This is a city that feels more like a small town, thanks to a welcoming and walkable centre of fish markets, galleries, restaurants and parks. It’s also one of the oldest port cities in Northern Europe – and with the UNESCO-listed Bryggen harbour to prove it. On our Bergen walking holidays, adventure is always in view. A funicular and cable car whisk walkers into the mountains and boats voyage into the fjords. Plus, there’s the train station – the gateway to some of the Europe’s most scenic train journeys.</p>
<h3>Exploring Bergen and beyond</h3>
<p>You don’t have to go far for interesting explorations on a Bergen holiday. Start in the city centre, delving into the wooden streets of Bryggen – remnants of one of Europe’s oldest wharfs – and then up (and up) into the cobbled streets and squares behind. The waterfront and 13th-century fish market are made for walking too, while the park comes with a fountain and a frame of art galleries and bars. If that sounds like a lot to fit into one day, don’t worry; the sun doesn’t set till 10.30pm in midsummer.</p>
<h3>Walking holidays in Bergen</h3>
<p>There’s some debate over which mountains are included in Bergen’s “city of the seven mountains” nickname. But one thing is for sure: Floyen and Ulriken are two of the favourites. A funicular has been carrying folk from the city centre to Mount Floyen for over 100 years. Jump aboard for an easy ride to the park, lake, café and a network of well-marked mountain paths. Or you can go for the heady heights of Ulriken – reached by cable car or, if you’re feeling daring, 1,300 stone-cut stairs. Your reward? Some of the best views and walks in Bergen, as well as a sunset-facing café terrace. </p>
<h3>Into the fjords</h3>
<p>Bergen hunkers down between Hardangerfjord and Sognefjord – two of the biggest fjords in Norway. Cruises push off from the harbour, including electric boats that smooth peacefully through the deep waters. Head to the Mostraumen straits on an easy half-day tour of sky-high waterfalls and berry-red fjordside villages. Or, you can head to Sognefjord for a whistlestop tour via Flam and experience the incredible scenery. Footpaths line the fjords too, weaving from waterfalls to villages to mighty mountain viewpoints. See our excursions for more details of these tours.</p>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Lifts</h3>
<p>Bergen has one cable car, the Ulriken643 cable car which usually operates daily from 1st May – 30th September. If you're staying near Bryggen harbour or in that area then you'll need to get a bus to the cable car as the cable car lower station is a little outside of Bergens main centre. By bus it takes around 20 minutes to get there with a short walk to the cable car lower station after. Once you've purchased your tickets to the cable car, you'll be whisked to the top where you'll get great views and there are a few walking trails to explore. (opening dates are subject to weather conditions, local schedules may change). </p>
<p>Another way to get into the mountains is to use the funicular. It's located a short walk from Bryggen in Bergen, and you can purchase tickets at the bottom and catch the funicular up to Mount Fløyen. At the top you’ll find a viewing area that looks over the city below as well as cafes, restaurants and plenty of hiking routes.</p>
<h3>Train</h3>
<p>There is a light rail network that is great for getting around the centre of Bergen. If you purchase the Bergen Card then it’s free to travel on the Bergen Light Rail Line number 1, between Bergen Airport and the city centre and line 2, between the city centre and Fyllingsdalen (this only applies to Bybanen light rail trains and included routes with the Bergen card are subject to change).</p>
<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>Buses are a great way to get around Bergen, with numerous routes and connections to take you around the city centre and outskirts. Buses are payable locally, however, if you purchase the Bergen Card then many of the local bus routes operated by Skyss are included in the card (included routes with the Bergen card are subject to change).</p>
<h3>Boats</h3>
<p>Boats are also a common mode of transport to get around in Norway and can be great to get further afield. If you purchase the Bergen Card then the boat to Askoy and Nordhordland is included in the card (included routes with the Bergen card are subject to change).</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The walking in Bergen is so good that every route could be classed as a favourite, but here are just a few routes that we really love:</p>
<p><strong>Hike up Lyderhorn - one of Bergen's seven mountains (4 kilometres from Bergen centre)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Approx. 3 hours of walking</li>
<li>Approx. 7.3 Kilometres</li>
<li>If you start in Gravdal you'll pass the Kvarven Fortress which dates back to 1899</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous trails up to Mount Lyderhorn including one that starts in Gravdal. To get to Gravdal you can take the bus direct to Lyderhornsveien, alternatively, you can change buses and go to Gravdal bus stop which is nearer the starting point (please double check bus routes in Bergen as they are subject to change and local schedules can vary). On the route you’ll pass by forests and even past former military installations, once you’re at the top you’ll have amazing 360 degree views towards the city and you’ll see the other six mountains that surround Bergen.</p>
<p><strong>Mount Fløyen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ability: Easy/moderate (depending on whether you decide to walk up or down the mountain, or both!)</li>
<li>Duration: Approx. 2 hours</li>
<li>A great route that's fairly central and you can tailor to your ability</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of options when it comes to walking Mount Fløyen so you can tailor the route to your ability. There's a funicular that goes to the top of the mountain so many choose to buy tickets and catch the funicular up and then walk back down to the city which is around 3.5 kilometres, all downhill with some lovely views along the way. If you're wanting to push yourself though you can walk up the mountain. It's quite challenging, with a constant uphill climb and some parts are quite steep - the views across the city when you reach the top though are well worth it. At the top of Mount Fløyen there's plenty happening with a couple of cafes and restaurants and a few other walking trails if you're looking to walk a bit further.</p>
<p><strong>Hike up Mount Lovstakken – one of Bergen's seven mountains (2 kilometres from Bergen Centre)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ascent/descent: Approx. 477 metres</li>
<li>Ability: Moderate</li>
<li>Duration: Approx. 2 hours of walking</li>
</ul>
<p>Situated 477 metres above sea level, Mount Lovstakken is the highest mountain on the west of Bergen city. There are a number of trails you can take to get to the top, one route starts at Lovstakkveien 51 which is around 10 minutes by bus from central Bergen (please double check bus routes in Bergen as they are subject to change and local schedules can vary). Follow the walking trail and once at the top you can enjoy fantastic panoramas of the local area – be sure to try and spot the other six mountains surrounding Bergen.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Summer holidays in Bergen offer plenty of walking and exploring, it's surrounded by seven mountains and acts as a gateway to the fjords]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>Bergen is termed a UNESCO City of Gastronomy so foodies will love exploring the cities bars and restaurants. Being surrounded by land and sea, the city has access to high quality produce and is mostly known for its seafood. Wander the fish market or dip into a local restaurant and try some local, traditional dishes.</p>
<h3>Bergen old town</h3>
<p>For those multi-coloured houses on the shores that Bergen is so well known for, head to Bryggen Wharf. This is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site due to its importance in the Hanseatic League’s trading empire that lasted for centuries. The buildings you see today have been rebuilt over the years but were built using the same methods they would have used hundreds of years ago. Today, you’ll find a few small businesses and shops in this area that generally promote local traditions and crafts.</p>
<h3>Culture and History</h3>
<p>The city of Bergen has plenty of gallery's, museums, and cultural experiences on offer and if you purchase the Bergen card then several of these can be accessed at a discounted rate. Whether you want to see masterpieces by Munch or some maritime history there’s something to suit everyone.</p>
<p>If art and music are of interest, then KODE is an organisation with several museums and composer’s homes under its umbrella. They all have different artists and composers works on display so do your research before you go, especially as temporary exhibitions are often changing but it’s a great introduction to some of Norway’s art history.</p>
<p>For those with a taste for contemporary art, you may want to visit the Bergen Kunsthall – there’s often several temporary exhibitions you can visit and the museums setting is lovely – right in front of the Lille Lungegardsvannet lake.</p>
<p>The Gamle Museum is fantastic fun for all. It’s an open-air museum set on a little street in Bergens old town. It shows what the original architecture was like and there are actors passing through the street in traditional dress. It’s an immersive experience to give a glimpse into what life was like back in the 1800s.</p>
<p>The Bergen Maritime Museum has a fascinating display showing Norway’s history with the sea over past centuries, with models of ships and boats as well as historic communication devices available to view. And if this floats your boat (pun intended), then why not head to the Bergenhus Fortress, it’s one of the oldest forts in Norway and has it’s own museum.</p>
<p>The Bergen Tekniske Museum will appeal to anyone with an interest in transportation and communication. Or, head to the Science Centre VilVite it’s great for children and adults with lots of interesting displays showcasing science and technology.</p>
<h3>Head to the Fjords</h3>
<p>There’s plenty of ways to get out and see the beautiful Fjords of Norway but being based in Bergen means you can reach the Fjords by water or land. The Hardangerfjord is the second largest in Norway and has incredible scenery, it takes a while to get there but it’s well worth a visit and there’s plenty of day trips on offer. Or, journey to the Sognefjord via the Flam railway, get amazing views of the valley before taking to the waters of the fjord by boat and take in those dramatic views. See our excursions below for more details.</p>
<h3>Journey outside of Bergen</h3>
<p>Head to one of the most active towns in Norway, Voss. For a day full of adventure, hop on one of the early trains and journey for around 1 hour 15 minutes before arriving in this charming Norwegian town. Once in Voss you can make the most of your day, explore the hiking routes, dine in some of the local restaurants, journey on the Voss cable car to get great views or, relax in the town centre and watch the world go by. After a wonderful day in Voss, you can head back on the train to Bergen (make sure you plan your journey in advance).</p>
<p>Make sure you checkout our excursions below for plenty of fun days out.</p>
<h3>The Bergen Line and Flam Railway</h3>
<p>Bergen train station marks the starting point of the Bergen Line. This is one of most scenic train journeys in Europe, chugging across the mountain plateaus and fjord-striped national parks between Bergen and Oslo. The whole thing takes 6.5 hours – but you can disembark after two hours at the mountain station of Myrdal and hop onto the famous Flam Railway. Cycling and hiking paths (and a zipline!) also lead from Myrdal to Flam, passing waterfalls, forests and a rushing river en route.</p>
<p>Make sure you checkout our excursions below for plenty of fun days out.</p>
<h3>Get into the mountains</h3>
<p>With seven mountains surrounding the city you're not short on great views and walking trails. If you're looking to see those panoramic city views without too much exertion though, then hop on the funicular and head for Mount Fløyen. You can purchase tickets at the station at the bottom not far from central Bergen and you're up there in less than 10 minutes. At the top you'll find a viewing area that looks down on the city below, it's the perfect picture spot. You'll also find a small number of cafes, restaurants and walking trails to try out if you're up to it. You can catch the funicular back down, or there's a 3.5 kilometre path you can follow that takes you back down into the city - it's downhill all the way, with some steeper parts but you get to see lovely views peaking through the trees as you descend.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking holidays in Bergen</h3>
<p>Bergen makes an excellent base for a walking holiday. Not only is the city centre nice and compact to allow you to explore on foot but there are also seven mountains surrounding the city with numerous walking routes to discover. It’s also a great launch pad for plenty of day trips and cruises to the Fjords. Amongst walking, there’s numerous other things to do in Bergen, whether you’re after a day of history and culture with a visit to one of the many museums or exploring the amazing food scene – there’s plenty to keep you busy.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
