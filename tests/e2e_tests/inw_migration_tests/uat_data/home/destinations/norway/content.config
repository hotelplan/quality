  <description><![CDATA[<p>Norway is the most northerly country in Scandinavia – and home to some of its most spectacular scenery. It’s also home to the philosophy of friluftsliv, a way of life that celebrates the joy of being in nature. Our Norway holidays take friluftsliv to heart, heading west to the fjords of the Atlantic coast, where mountains sweep up from glacier-cut valleys and colourful houses collect on the shores. Walks range from waterfall wanders to ridge treks, all tied together by a scenic network of mountain trains, buses, ferries and cable cars. That includes the Bergen Line – a cinematic train route that flows into the famous Flam Railway.</p>
<h2>Walking holidays in Norway</h2>
<p>Whether it's challenging hikes in the fjords you're after, valley level walks or leisurely city strolls there's plenty of choice when it comes to Norway. <a data-udi="umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/d517b2c21fa94eb096a3bcb6b7e933c5}" title="Bergen">Bergen</a> is a city surrounded by seven mountains so you're not short on walking trails (and panoramic city views!). Bergen's public transport options also make it easy to get out and about to discover new trails. Head to <a data-udi="umb://document/3bff04d1881648b5a6163cdd11cfb562" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3bff04d1881648b5a6163cdd11cfb562}" title="Voss">Voss</a> for adventurous hikes or lake side wanders, the Voss cable car takes you to new heights and new paths with a variety of hiking levels on offer. <a data-udi="umb://document/18b94b9d5f4d4510a6c23eecf8a70de1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/18b94b9d5f4d4510a6c23eecf8a70de1}" title="Flam &amp; Aurland">Flam, Aurland</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/a09d8dda0d4f48d68be229cdaeb2f377" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a09d8dda0d4f48d68be229cdaeb2f377}" title="Balestrand">Balestrand</a> sit within the fjords and the mountainous setting means you're not short on challenging hikes - they're worth it though, the fjord scenery in these areas really is spectacular.</p>
<h3>Explore the fjords and fall in love</h3>
<p>Western Norway is fjord country. Retreating glaciers carved out dramatic valleys long ago. Now filled with seawater, these deep sunken valleys are best explored by walking – or by rafting, kayaking, cycling… or simply by kicking back at a viewpoint with a glass of Hardanger cider. But with 1,000 or so fjords to choose from, where to start? We recommend the many branches of Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord, Norway’s biggest fjords. Naeroyfjord, near Flam, was one of the inspirations for Arendelle in Frozen, so fairy-tale scenes are guaranteed.</p>
<h3>From ferries to the Flam Railway </h3>
<p>You can ditch the car in Norway. Boats and buses bustle between the villages and footpaths of the fjords. More postcard views come courtesy of the Flam Railway that climbs from Flam village to the mountain station of Myrdal. Up here (over 850m up, in fact), there’s a hiking and cycling route – and even a zipwire – back down to Flam. Or you can forge onwards along the Bergen Line for one of the most beautiful train journeys in Europe.</p>
<h3>Brilliant bases: Bergen, Balestrand and beyond</h3>
<p>Bergen is a city of many inspiring nicknames – “city between the seven mountains”, for one – and it lives up to them all. It makes a great base if you fancy a side of city life with your mountain adventures. Alternatively, delve deeper into the fjords and stay in a waterside village. Great spots include cruise ship favourite Flam, neighbouring Aurland, and the cosy artist’s colony of Balestrand. Voss is another excellent option, and a haven for adventure seekers looking to launch themselves into everything from hiking and biking to whitewater rafting.</p>
<h3>Dig into Norwegian cuisine</h3>
<p>Norway is a feast for adventurers in need of refuelling. Many dishes take their inspiration from the fjords and mountains around, with fish markets transforming the day’s catch into chowder-like soup and fishcakes, and smoked slabs of salmon. Vegetables are seasonal; think herby potatoes and mushrooms. Berries also often end up on your plate, chopped up into salads and drizzled over waffles. Meanwhile, valley orchards transform apples into juices, ciders and wines. The perfect garnish? A terrace with a fjord view. The sun sets around 10.30pm in midsummer, so you can take your time dining.</p>]]></description>
