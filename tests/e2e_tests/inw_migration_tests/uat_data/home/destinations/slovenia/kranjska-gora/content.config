  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Visit the impressive Marjuljek Waterfalls on an Inghams Guided Walk</li>
<li>Take a refreshing dip in the brightly-coloured Lake Jasna</li>
<li>Ride the exhilarating summer toboggan down from Vitranc</li>
</ul>
<p>The Alpine town of Kranjska Gora sits on a bend of the Pišnica river, overlooked by forested foothills and limestone peaks. This is where the Julian Alps meet the Austrian and Italian borders, up in the far north-west of Slovenia. Thousand-year-old larch forests, Alpine meadows, blue lakes and rivers shape the landscape here – making for exciting walking country that stretches into Triglav National Park. Despite the dramatic vistas, many of the walks in Kranjska Gora are moderate, with plenty of easy strolls between neighbouring villages.</p>
<h2>Walking in Kranjska Gora</h2>
<p>Around 146 kilometres of marked footpaths explore Kranjska Gora and its surroundings. The long-distance Juliana Trail starts in town – a 267 kilometre epic that can be walked in smaller stages, with mountain views at every twist and turn. Walk to the high waterfalls close to the small village of Gozd Martuljek - the impressive Martuljek Falls are in two stages and cascade into a dramatic limestone gorge. Other hiking highlights include the Krnica valley and the turquoise headwaters of the Sava Dolinka river. Or tick a few other countries off your stepped-in list on the Triple Border walk, where the borders of Slovenia, Italy and Austria all meet.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Kranjska Gora</h3>
<p>Kranjska Gora might be a popular ski resort by winter, but by summer it’s a postcard of green hills, cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses, all finished off with a grand gothic church. The emerald waters of Lake Jasna sit to the south of town; sandy shores and refreshing swims are the theme here. Alternatively, treat yourself to a meal in the nearby Restaurant Milka, which has two Michelin stars under its belt, thanks to the inspired Nordic-Alpine menu and Slovenian wine list. </p>
<p>Adventure enthusiasts and families with active teens are bound to love Kranjska Gora - there's a mountain biking trail and mountain rollercoaster underneath the Vitranc chairlift. Try via ferrata or paragliding, zip lining at Planica or perhaps some stand-up paddle boarding on Lake Jasna. If you are looking for more of a thrill, then head to the river Soca for some white water rafting, an exhilarating experience for teens and adults. Plus, the famously photogenic <a data-udi="umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e}" title="Lake Bled">Lake Bled</a> is only an hour’s bus journey away.</p>
<h3>Village hopping along the Sava valley</h3>
<p>A short drive or cycle west takes you to Podkoren village, a collection of 17th Century farmhouses and inns set in a wildflower valley. Keep following the road parallel to the Austria border, and you’ll reach Rateče – another picturesque village and home to one of Slovenia’s oldest churches. Don’t miss Zelenci Nature Reserve as you pass through. Here, boardwalks lead to a luminous turquoise lake and wetlands alive with nesting birds, amphibians and rare plants like the carnivorous sundew. Or, just two kilometres away you will find the famous Nordic Ski Centre, where you can admire the ski jumpers practicing all year round. We also love to head over the Italian border along the cycle path to Laghi di Fusine, perfect for unlocking access to the beautiful double lakes set below the majestic mount Mangart.</p>
<h3>Explore the Triglav National Park and beyond</h3>
<p>Kranjska Gora is an excellent launch pad for exploring Slovenia’s only National Park, crowned by its highest peak, Mount Triglav at 2,864 metres. Walks range from forest and waterfall wanders to longer treks to craggy limestone peaks. Get in and amongst the most dramatic scenery at the top of the Vršič Pass - the highest mountain pass in Slovenia, and the starting point for some fantastic Alpine hikes. On the other side of the pass, the <span>Soča Valley is paradise for outdoor adventures. For quick and easy exploration hop on the public bus, connecting Kranjska Gora to the top of the pass, and to Trenta valley.</span></p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday to Kranjska Gora with Inghams?</h2>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h2>Family activities in Kranjska Gora</h2>
<h3>Summer Toboggan</h3>
<p>Riding the summer toboggan down from the top of the Vitranc chairlift is a fun way to get back into Kranjska Gora – enjoy the views on the way up the lift and feel the adrenaline on the way down. The toboggan is 1,500 metres long, with a vertical drop of 293 metres, so you’re sure of an unforgettable five-minute ride from top to bottom.</p>
<h3>Family Adventure to Kekec’s Land</h3>
<p>Immerse yourselves in the natural beauty and rich, cultural heritage of Kranjska Gora on a two-hour guided adventure that’s fun for the whole family. The journey begins in Kekchev, a short bus ride from Kranjska Gora, and explores the local myths and legends of the area with fun activities along the way (tours in English are available in July and August, every Tuesday).</p>
<h3>Planica Nordic Centre</h3>
<p>Head just down the road to Rateče, and get ready to experience weightlessness as you and the kids zoom down Europe's steepest zip line reaching intense speeds of 85 kilometres an hour. Or, fly up, down, side to side, and spin in the giant indoor wind tunnel.</p>
<p>Perhaps the adrenaline rush isn't for you? Then keep your feet on the ground and enjoy a game of disc golf, look around the famous ski jump museum, or simply take in the beautiful mountains you'll be embedded within.</p>
<h3>Family Walking Trails and Educational Spots</h3>
<p>Embarking on the Drčev Rut trim trail will have you walking on the Kneipp path and partly alongside the Pišnica River. With three kilometres consisting of 12 stations and a variety of terrain, you'll visit Lake Jasna along the way. There are activities both adults and children can take part in, including jumping, climbing, and balance training.</p>
<p>Nature lovers and young explorers alike can discover the educational beekeeping areas in Rateče. Take in the sights of the Upper Sava Valley alongside this easy stroll as you learn about the story of honey production and the importance of bees. Will your little ones love to find the beehives, outdoor galleries, and large planted gardens?</p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Buses</h3>
<p>All buses depart from Kranjska Gora Bus Stop, next to Skipass Hotel. There is an hourly bus from Rateče to Ljubljana and a bus to Vršič mountain pass and towards Bovec village that runs in high season. You can also reach Lake Bled by bus - you will need to make one change in Lesce.</p>
<p>You can pay a one-way cash fare to the driver when you get on the bus, but please bear in mind that your return trip will not necessarily be by the same bus company or the same price. Timetables are displayed at the stops and can also be picked up from the tourist office or your hotel.</p>
<h3>Chair Lift</h3>
<p>The Vitranc 1 chairlift is open all year round and brings you up to the 1,111-metre-high Bedančev dom where you can enjoy the views over the Karavanke mountain range towards Austria. The hut is a perfect spot for a drink before picking a route down. You have a choice of walking down the slope, taking the chairlift back down, or (our favourite) riding down with a summer toboggan. For serious hikers there is a steep walk to the very top of Vitranc mountain and another mountain hut Mojčin dom, where you get rewarded with one of the best views in the area.</p>
<p>The chairlift is around €17 for a return trip or €13 for a single ride.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <guidedWalks><![CDATA[<h2>Inghams guided walks - included in your holiday</h2>
<p>We’ve included two full-day walks per week in Kranjska Gora, just for Inghams guests. Join a small group and be led by a professional walking guide on some of their favourite trails. It’s a great way to get to know the area. </p>
<p>In Summer 25, they're available from 26 May - 12 Sep. They will run every Monday and Friday and you can add them onto your holiday at the time of booking, through My Booking or by calling us on 01483 319 652.</p>
<p>Routes may vary from week to week but as a guide you can see our planned routes below:</p>
<h3>Krnica Valley</h3>
<p>The Krnica Valley is located in the Triglav National Park and is surrounded by beautiful mountains. The valley is six kilometres long, starting at Lake Jasna running along the Pišnica stream towards the peak of the Razor Mountain and Vršič Mountain Pass. The walking route follows the valley through meadows and forests, with dramatic peaks all around. At the Krnica Mountain Hut you have a stop where you can buy lunch. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: Easy to moderate (a reasonable fitness and sure-footedness is required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 14.5km </li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 6 hours (walking time approx. 4 hours 30 minutes)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 314m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong>: Mainly gentle mountain path along the gravel path</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: There will be a stop at the Krnica Mountain Hut or Mihov Dom Hut where you can buy lunch. In July and August, when it is hotter, you'll take the public bus to the Russian Chapel, walk across to the mountain Hut and then back along the river trail. The distance would be 10.4km, duration 4 hours (walking time 3 hours).</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk will run: every Monday</p>
<h3>Srednji vrh</h3>
<p>You get the most beautiful views of the Martuljek Mountains and Mt. Špik on this amazing walk. Srednji vrh is located at 972 metres above sea level and is on the opposite side of the Julian Alps to Kranjska Gora, giving amazing views of them in the distance, with lush green meadows and forests in front of them. You'll have a stop at the Log House Krmiše or in the Špik campsite where you can buy lunch. After lunch you will head to see the first Martuljek waterfall and then walk back to the village (it is possible to take the bus back instead which would save you 5km walk).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>: Moderate (a reasonable fitness and sure-footedness is required)</li>
<li><strong>Distance</strong>: 14.4km</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 6 hours (walking time approx. 5 hours)</li>
<li><strong>Ascent/descent</strong>: 441m</li>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong>: Mainly forest path or gravel track (may be quite uneven in places)</li>
<li><strong>Useful information</strong>: There will be a stop at the Log House Krmiše or in the Špik campsite where you can buy lunch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk will run: every Friday</p>
<p><strong>For every walk you will need: </strong>suitable walking shoes with good grip, appropriate clothing, sun cream, insect repellent, sunglasses, rain jacket, a warmer layer, rucksack, at least a litre of water, a snack and cash for mountain huts/transport. You may find walking poles useful.</p>
<p><em>Early booking is strongly recommended as spaces are limited. All walks are subject to availability of local guides, weather conditions and maximum numbers. Planned routes are subject to change. Any times, distances and ascents/descents stated are approximate. Full details of the walks with the meeting points and routes will be provided to you on arrival. In some instances there may be a small charge for local transport that is payable locally. In resorts where the walks run over more than two days, the day of the walk will be allocated to you by your Rep in your welcome meeting. Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavour to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking. The decision of the guide on the suitability of the walk for you is final and no compensation will be paid where the guide believes, in their professional opinion, that it is not suitable. Please ensure you are well-equipped for the walk have suitable clothing and footwear. Walks are not recommended for guests under 12 years. Any guests under 18 years will need to be accompanied by an adult.</em></p>]]></guidedWalks>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The Julian Alps are walker’s wonderland, its meadows, valleys and mountains carved up by a well-worn nexus of waymarked paths and trails. From Kranjska Gora, trails head off into the Planica and Tamar Valleys, as well as up the Vršič Pass, from where further tracks fan out in several directions. A short way east of Kranjska Gora, a trio of valleys – the most prominent being the Vrata valley – provide the starting point for ascents towards Triglav itself.</p>
<p>In and around Kranjska Gora there are numerous marked walking trails suitable for all kind of walkers, leading to Triglav National Park where you can spot Alpine flowers and animals in their natural environment and see the peaks of Mt Prisank, Mt. Vitranc and Vršič Pass. The landscape is dotted with waterfalls and trails through valleys with small villages and farmhouses.</p>

</ul>
<p><span>The trip starts and ends in Kranjska Gora. It's an easy walk on the cart track through the meadows where you can watch cattle grazing.

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h2>Things to do in Kranjska Gora</h2>
<h3>Lake Jasna</h3>
<p>You can't visit Kranjska Gora and not take a stroll to Lake Jasna, which is just outside of town (around 20 minutes on foot). It's known for its clear, emerald-green waters set amongst beautiful mountains. The lake isn't too large so it's easy to walk around and there are small piers in various sections so you can admire the clear waters. You'll also find a few restaurants and cafés near the lake where you can sit and take in the view.</p>
<h3>Zelenci Nature Reserve</h3>
<p>Around four kilometres outside of Kranjska Gora you'll find Zelenci Nature Park, a wetland area with a small emerald green lake with crystal clear waters that never freeze - even in winter. There's a small boardwalk you can use to access the lake and you'll be in awe of the surroundings with the dramatic peaks of the Julian Alps reflected in the water - head to the small observatory for fantastic views and information on the park.</p>
<h3>Get sporty</h3>
<p>The mountains surrounding Kranjska Gora make for some great cycling. The routes are generally quite challenging but you'll be rewarded with fantastic views. We also love the scenic ride along the family cycle path from Jesenice to Tarvision in Italy, perfect for a day trip to another country. If you like tennis then you can play just outside the main town, it is hard to find courts with views as impressive as these. There's also a golf course that offers six holes and a practice range with incredible scenery.</p>
<p>Many guests like to combine their holidays in Kranjska Gora with a trip to another resort or city. We recommend <a data-udi="umb://document/5cfd5f91c1d0419185792bc414ff7721" href="/{localLink:umb://document/5cfd5f91c1d0419185792bc414ff7721}" title="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e}" title="Lake Bled">Bled</a> or <a data-udi="umb://document/b56bdaf2399f46828fa1f01256cae753" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b56bdaf2399f46828fa1f01256cae753}" title="Lake Bohinj">Bohinj</a>.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Kranjska Gora. There's nowhere to hire equipment in resort so take what you need with you.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>Detailed walking maps are available from the Tourist Office or most hotel receptions.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Slovenia Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
