  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Walk the magnificent Soča Trail alongside the river</li>
<li>Take on an exhilarating rafting trip or a leisurely paddleboard</li>
<li><span>Visit the Alpine Botanical Garden Juliana to see around 600 species of alpine plants</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The picturesque village of Bovec lies between the mountains and rivers of the Julian Alps on the doorstep of the Triglav National Park, which covers four percent of Slovenia. With the highest peaks of the Julian Alps on one side and the bright-blue River Soča on the other, Bovec is the perfect holiday destination for reconnecting with nature. You’ll recognise the beautiful River Soča as the location for many of the scenes in the 2008 film "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" - it's so blue it could pass as a tropical sea.</p>
<h2>Walking in Bovec and the Soča Valley</h2>
<p>Take to the challenge of hiking up Mount Svinjak, and gaze over rewarding views from its unique peak. Here you can often see herds of ibex which are able to climb almost vertical rocks! Or, stroll through the village, taking in the World War I monuments, admiring Gothic churches and traditional local houses and wandering along the shore of a meandering river. There's so much to see and do in this undiscovered part of Slovenia.</p>
<h3>Visit Triglav National Park</h3>
<p>Bovec sits at the edge of the Triglav National Park, in the Julian Alps. UNESCO declared the Julian Alps as Slovenia's first biosphere reserve of international importance, and the Triglav National Park contains some of its best bits. Discover the Šunik Water Grove, or the source of the River Soča which springs from a cave; home to a small subterranean lake. You can walk the famous Soča Trail from the river's source all the way back to Bovec. Along the way, admire the dramatic Great Soča Gorge from the wooden hanging bridge where the gorge begins. Or, head to the end of the gorge where the whirling rapids calm down and there's a popular swim spot.</p>
<h3>Adventurous activities in Bovec</h3>
<p>It's impossible to come to Bovec on holiday and overlook the amount of adrenaline-inducing activities you can get involved with. The River Soča is the perfect spot to try some white-water rafting or kayaking- or perhaps some paddle-boarding on a calmer section of water if you don't want such a wild ride. Admire the scenery from above with a picturesque paraglide, or, hop on a bike and explore on two wheels- with all the natural beauty around you, your camera will constantly be busy snapping pictures.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in the Soča Valley</h3>
<p>On a walk through the Juliana Alpine Botanical Gardens you can see around 600 species of plants native to the valleys and mountain-tops of the surrounding Alpine region. Visit the impressive Kluže Fortress above the Koritnica Gorge or discover some of the bigger towns of the Soča Valley. Kobarid is a historic town below the Krn mountain - it was an important battle location during World War 1 and the Kobarid Museum is well worth a visit.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday to Bovec with Inghams?</h2>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of the Soča Valley's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>
<p>With 90 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Bovec include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team overseas can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p>During peak tourist season (normally July-August) a network of buses serve Bovec and the surrounding area to help you get out and explore.</p>
<h3>Hop-on-hop-off buses</h3>
<p>From Bovec there is a network of Hop-on-hop-off buses to places of interest and neighbouring valleys. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>B1 - Bovec - Mangartsko Sedlo - Bovec</li>
<li>B2 - Bovec - Lepena Koča - Bovec</li>
<li>B3 - Bovec - Virje - Bovec</li>
<li>B4 - Bovec - Čezsoča - Bovec</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have purchased the Julian Alps Card: Soča Valley (available to buy locally), these Hop-on-hop-off buses are included.</p>
<h3>Regular buses</h3>
<p>There are two regular buses from Bovec:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a - Bovec - Izvir Soče - Vršič - Kranjska Gora</li>
<li>1b - Bovec - Trenta - Izvir Soče - Bovec</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these buses to explore further afield and access the starting point to many nice walks, including the Soča Trail which starts at Izvir Soče and follows the Soča River back to Bovec.</p>
<p>These two buses are also included on the Julian Alps Card: Soča Valley which you can buy locally.</p>
<h3>Kobarid and Tolmin buses</h3>
<p>Similar to Bovec, the towns of Kobarid and Tolmin have a network of Hop-on-hop-off buses or shuttle-buses that you can use to explore the wider area. Plus, from Tolmin you can catch bus number 2 which crosses the border into Italy and runs as far as Cividale del Friuli.</p>
<h3>Train</h3>
<p>If you want to explore even further afield, the nearest train station is in Most na Soči, where a service runs to Ljubljana, calling at Bohinjska Bistrica and Bled.</p>
<p>However, if you're wanting to explore more of Bohinj and Bled, we recommend booking Bovec as part of our <a data-udi="umb://document/a0191268612e4a3389b47a26550db553" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a0191268612e4a3389b47a26550db553}" title="Discover the Julian Alps">Discover the Julian Alps</a> multi-centre holiday which starts in Bohinj (from where you can easily take a day trip to Bled) and finishes in Kranjska Gora with a few days in Bovec in between.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>The Soča Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of the route is technically easy but it's a long walk (the section to the river source is challenging but it can be avoided)</li>
<li>25km with 400m height gain</li>
<li>Approx. 8-10 hours walking time</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't come to Bovec on a walking holiday without hearing about the famous Soča Trail - it's the oldest and longest trail in the Triglav National Park and follows the River Soča from close to its source back to Bovec. Along the way you'll follow old footpaths and discover hidden, lesser-known parts of the valley- there are several places to stop for refreshments along the way too, and you'll pass the start and end of the magnificent Great Soča Gorge.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to visit the actual source of the river, there's a marked trail from the cabin near the source of the river to the actual source which takes around 15 minutes. It's a maintained trail, but very demanding in the higher parts, with a small via ferrata section with wire ropes and wedges for protection. This part of the walk is challenging and requires good fitness and sure-footedness. You can easily skip this section and begin the walk from where the bus stops.</p>
<h3>Virje Waterfall</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Approx. 9.5km with 325m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Approx. 2-3 hours walking time</li>
</ul>
<p>This relatively easy walk starts and finishes in Bovec so you don't need any public transport to enjoy the beautiful views of the Soča Valley. You'll pass through the quiet village of Plužna on the way to the picturesque Virja waterfall and then on the way back, you'll pass a small hydroelectric plant where, in good weather, you can capture a perfect reflective photo of the surrounding hills. If you want to explore a little further, you can visit the Gljun springs which originate from the underground Karst caverns of the Kanin mountain- particularly impressive after rainfall.</p>
<h3>Brjeka Trail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Approx. 10km with 125m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Approx. 2.5-3 hours walking time</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk is a great way to enjoy some local scenery and get up close with the dazzling waters of the Soča River. It's a relatively easy loop, from Bovec to Čezsoča and where the path then follows the river to the Brjeka footbridge. Cross the footbridge to return via the Koritnica bridge to the Vodenca campground. Along the way look out for skydivers near the airfield and enjoy the spectacular colour of the river as it meanders through the rocks.</p>
<h3>Lake Krn</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Around 10km with 810m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Approx. 6 hours walking time</li>
</ul>
<p>Lake Krn is the largest Slovenian high-mountain lake, at an altitude of 1,394 metres and is a wonderful walk in the Triglav National Park, surrounded by dramatic mountain peaks and vast forests. The route follows an old military mule track and there are a couple of mountain huts for refreshments. In July and August, a hop-on hop-off bus from Bovec runs around three times a day to the starting point at Dom dr. Klementa Juga in the Lepena valley.</p>
<h3>Mt. Svinjak</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging summit hike (good fitness and sure-footedness required)</li>
<li>Approx. 15km with 1,335m ascent/descent</li>
<li>Approx. 6-8 hours walking time (you can shorten it by starting and/or finishing at Kal Koritnica instead of in Bovec centre)</li>
</ul>
<p>Get some of the most wonderful views of Bovec on this challenging summit hike- the route ascends through beech forest and the last 150 vertical metres are quite steep, requiring a good head for heights as you make it to the summit ridge. Here, you'll be rewarded with spectacular views over Bovec and the surrounding area. On the way down, it's worth a visit to the World War I Čelo Battle Station.</p>
<h3>Juliana Trail – a walk around the Kingdom of the Golden horn</h3>
<p>The Juliana Trail, a 270 kilometre-long circular long-distance trail, offers an exciting opportunity to explore the area at the doorway to the Julian Alps, leading you under the high peaks and inviting you to explore them. The trail is divided into 16 sections, with an average length of around 17.5 km. The sections are designed so that, at the completion of each, hikers can take a break and regain their strength to continue their journey. The trail covers a total of 7,163 metres of altitude difference, but its terrain is generally quite gentle, making it great for family outings.</p>
<p>Stage 13: Kobarid - Bovec is 20.4km long, easy (but long) and takes approx. 6 hours</p>
<p>Stage 14: Bovec - Log pod Mangartom is 11.3km long, moderate and takes approx. 3 hours</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

<h2>Things to do in Bovec</h2>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>Walking in Bovec is for everyone from a casual stroller to an intense trekker. Simply make your way around the seven-kilometre Bovec loop in your own time, or complete more challenging routes with steep inclines. The Mount Svinjak summit hike is great for avid walkers– reaching spectacular viewpoints, with a chance of seeing some friendly wild mountain goats along the way.</p>

<h3>Why we love walking in Bovec</h3>
<p>With around 97km of marked walking trails and spectacular scenery, there's a lot to love about this area. Bovec has some of the highest peaks of the Julian Alps on one side, and the bright-blue River Soča on the other, so the views are incredible at every turn. The wider Soča Valley has even more walking routes on offer too, so for keen walkers and nature enthusiasts, there's lots to discover in this relatively untouched part of Slovenia.</p>
<p>In Slovenia, walking routes are marked either red or yellow; yellow are the thematic trails and red are the mountain trails. In Bovec there's around 62km of red-marked trails and 35km of yellow-marked trails. In the wider Soča Valley, there's around 265km of red-marked trails and 179km of yellow-marked trails. </p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
