  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Take a historic Pletna boat to the iconic Bled Island</li>
<li>Discover some beautiful walking trails and views on an Inghams Guided Walk</li>
<li>Tread the wooden walkways through the impressive Vintgar Gorge</li>
</ul>
<p>Lake Bled is the star of Slovenia in the summer – an alpine lake with a church-topped island that is the darling of guidebooks and social media feeds the world over. A day trip to Bled barely scratches the surface of this beautiful lake and town. Walking holidays in Lake Bled, however, give you the time to meander along the water’s edge, exploring forested footpaths, diving into lidos, wandering between cafés (make sure you try Bled's famous Kremšnita cake) and clambering up to Bled Castle. Holidays to Lake Bled are also a great for doing nothing but settling down on a terrace, watching the pletna boats glide by and enjoying the sunshine.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/e7f3dcd3d1924383a81ca2bbd6ee8286" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e7f3dcd3d1924383a81ca2bbd6ee8286}" title="Lake Bled" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Lake Bled walking deals</strong></a></p>
<h3>Explore Lake Bled on a summer holiday</h3>
<p>Walking a lap of Lake Bled is one of the loveliest wanders in Europe. It takes about 1.5 hours at a brisk pace, and less on a bike, but we recommend stretching it out over at least half a day – and packing swimwear for the swim spots en route. The water peaks at an irresistible 25˚C in summer.</p>
<p>From Bled town, you’ll pass a lido, water sports centre and intriguing walking trails that snake up into the forested foothills, as you draw ever closer to the famous island at the end of the lake. Returning to Bled, the Medieval Bled Castle dominates the view - the promise of lake and mountain panoramas should give you the boost needed to make it to the top of the hill.</p>
<h3>Summer activities in Lake Bled: visit Bled Island by pletna boat</h3>
<p>Ferrymen in wooden “pletna” boats have been rowing pilgrims and summer holiday makers between shore and island since the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Once on dry land, visitors can admire the towering Assumption of Mary Church, which stands on the foundations of an even older Slavic temple. If you get a chance, have a chat with the boat captain on the way back. The pletna are mostly steered by people whose families have rowed these waters for generations and they often have some great stories to share.</p>
<h3>Family holidays to Lake Bled: toboggans, lake lidos and honey bees</h3>
<p>Lake Bled offers a choice of family-friendly activities and walks and is perfect for a family summer holiday. Walk or take the lift up to Straža, where kids (and big kids) can rocket down the mountain on the summer toboggan. The lakeside pools and slides of the lido welcome families too. Paddleboards and rowing boats stock the water sports centre – an excellent chance to test your pletna paddling technique and up at Bled Castle there's hands-on activities for children in summer, including papermaking workshops and honey tastings at the resident beehives.</p>
<h3>Walking in Julian Alps and sightseeing in Ljubljana</h3>
<p>Many summer holiday-makers come to Bled to relax and enjoy the sights, but there's a lot to discover on foot, too. The eastern arm of the Julian Alps reaches towards Lake Bled making for a great walking holiday. The Vintgar Gorge is a must-visit, where wooden walkways and bridges hang above the turquoise Radovna River. The Pokljuka Plateau, on the edge of neighbouring Triglav National Park, is dotted with old shepherd's huts and great for walks through green mountain pastures.</p>

Join a professional walking guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</p>

  <festivals><![CDATA[<h3>Straža Bled</h3>
<p>The hill known as Straža Bled, is a hive of activity in the summer, mainly due to the exciting summer toboggan that speeds down the hillside. The way up to Straža isn't too difficult, following a nice path shaded by trees, and the view from the top is worth the climb. If you don't fancy the uphill on foot though, you can relax and enjoy the chairlift ride instead.</p>
<h3>Bled Lido</h3>
<p>The lido is heaven for children with lots of energy to burn - there's waterslides and platforms to jump into the lake, or you can rent a rowing boat or stand-up paddleboard and venture further into the water. For a hot summer's afternoon, the lido is the place to be. There's a café and bar too. </p>]]></festivals>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Buses and trains</h3>
<p>Much of the area around Bled is easily explored on foot, but there's a great network of buses and trains if you want to head further afield - it takes around 40 minutes by bus to get to Bohinj or around an hour and a half to get to Ljubljana.</p>
<p>You can also ride around Lake Bled on the little tourist train.</p>
<h3>Straža chairlift</h3>
<p>The only chairlift in Bled rises up the Straža hill - it's most popular when going to ride the summer toboggan, but also offers walkers an easier way to the summit.</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<h3>A lap of Lake Bled</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy</li>
<li>6km with around 25m height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>A lap of the lake is the easiest and most popular walk in Bled, and a very pleasant one too, especially at sunrise or sunset. We like to do this walk in a clockwise direction from Bled - if it's a warm day you can have a swim and an ice cream at the far western end of the lake. </p>
<h3>Straža Hill</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate</li>
<li>2.5km with around 144m height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to climb the Straža hill (not including the chairlift to the top!) is from the village of Želeče by the bottom of the chairlift. The route joins the fitness trail, if you fancy an extra challenge on the obstacles, and weaves up through the trees with great views back towards Bled and the lake. The summer toboggan makes an exciting way to get down.</p>
<h3>Ojstrica Viewpoint and Velika Osojnica</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate - challenging</li>
<li>3km with 273m height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1 and a half hours</li>
</ul>
<p>At the western end of Lake Bled, this walk is a rewarding one, which climbs steeply through the trees to the peaks of Mala Osojnica and Velika Osojnica and the Ojstrica viewpoint. It's a must-do for the views which look over Bled and its surroundings in one direction and the Pokljuka and Mežakla Plateaus in the other. It's a well-kept trail but there's a few steep steps along the way - you can turn back whenever you like.</p>
<h3>Stan In Smreka Velikanka</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate</li>
<li>5km with around 209m height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around 1.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Stan is Slovenian for shepherd's dwelling and this walk takes you over three plains that used to be used for grazing cattle. You'll pass an impressive spruce tree that's 37 metres tall and nearly 4 metres around its trunk, and plenty of spots to enjoy the views of Lake Bled.</p>
<h3>Ribno to the Talež Hunting Lodge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate - challenging</li>
<li>7.5km with around 468m of height gain</li>
<li>Expect to take around 3 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>After a leisurely start along the banks of the Sava Bohinjka river, the trail climbs steeply up to the Talež Lodge a popular refreshment stop with incredible views before potentially extending your hike to the Tolsti vrh peak. The grassy plain of Talež is hidden from the valley on the Jelovica plateau, and offers incredible views all the way to Bled and Radovljica and the mountains of the Triglav National Park. The trail is steep and requires good footwear, but the views are well worth the climb.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[A summer holiday in Lake Bled is best enjoyed at leisure, with leisurely lakeside strolls and refreshing swims]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Explore Bled</h3>
<p>Right on the edge of the lake, Bled is a bustling town where there's always something going on. Find a cute café and try Bled's famous cream cake, or tuck into some traditional Slovenian food. When it's time to explore, it's easily discoverable on foot and you'll find beautiful, well-kept lakeside gardens with plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view. Enjoy the scenery at leisure in a horse-drawn carriage, or rent a bike and cycle village to village. Bled has something for everyone including one of Europe's most scenic golf courses.</p>
<h3>Ride a pletna boat to Bled Island</h3>
<p>The traditional wooden pletna boats have been taking visitors to the island in the middle of the lake for centuries. These boats are operated by standing rowers known as pletnars, who are locals that have inherited their job role. A peaceful glide along the lake will take you to the charming Bled Island - the only island in Slovenia. Count the stairs, and make a wish by pulling the wish-bell.</p>
<h3>Bird's eye views from Bled Castle</h3>
<p>The view from Bled Castle is worth the clamber up through the forest. Its history dates back to 1004 and it was slowly added to over hundreds of years, before suffering damage from an earthquake in 1511. Since then, it's been rebuilt, and extended into the beautiful castle we see today, home to a frescoe-painted gothic chapel and impressive architecture. Delve into the history of Bled in the museum, see traditional hand printing techniques or visit the castle wine cellar. Make sure to spend plenty of time enjoying the view over the lake. </p>
<h3>Wellness in Lake Bled</h3>
<p>Arnold Rikli first brought wellness tourism to Bled - encouraging people to get out into nature, walking, breathing the fresh air, and swimming. Bled's the perfect place for it, with its warm mountain climate, unspoilt nature and pleasant water temperatures. The thermal springs in the north-eastern part of the lake are said to have healing properties and supply the swimming pools of some of the hotels in Bled. You can swim in the lake at the far-western edge - it's the perfect spot, around half way through a walk around the lake starting from Bled town, or you can visit the lido beneath Bled castle, which has slides and areas to relax by the water.</p>
<p>Many of our hotels have excellent wellness facilities, and the <a data-udi="umb://document/093bbc54785244aa9aa802856c0b18e8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/093bbc54785244aa9aa802856c0b18e8}" title="Grand Hotel Toplice">Grand Hotel Toplice</a> also benefits from direct lake access from its private lido area. </p>
<h3>Watersports</h3>
<p>The best way to experience Lake Bled, is to get in, or on, the water. Rent a rowing boat or kayak and head out onto the lake, stand-up paddle boarding is popular too. You can even rent a clear-bottomed kayak or try scuba-diving. For a little more adrenaline, the rivers of Sava Bohinjka and Sava Dolinka are popular for rafting, kayaking or canoeing - eventually they merge to become the Sava - Slovenia's largest river. You can try canyoning in the gorges too.</p>
<h3>Visit Vintgar Gorge</h3>
<p>When it was first discovered, the Vintgar Gorge was impassable, but you don't have to get wet to visit it - thanks to over 500 metres of bridges and galleries, you can experience what's now one of Slovenia's most important natural attractions. Unique rock formations have been carved by the Radovna River and its waterfalls, pools and rapids - the 13 metres high Šum Waterfall is one of the highlights.</p>
<p>Hidden in the cliffs of Iglica, above Bohinjska Bela is the 24-metre high Iglica Waterfall - these cliffs are a popular spot for sport climbers. </p>
<h3>Traditional alpine farming on the Pokljuka Plateau</h3>
<p>The Pokljuka Plateau is a huge area, around 20 kilometres long and almost 20 kilometres wide, with a unique karst landscape, shaped by the Pokljuka glacier and home to many plants and animals. The tradition of Alpine farming continues on the Pokljuka Plateau in summer, and cattle spend sunny days grazing the pastures and living in traditional wooden sheds. Experience a bit of life as it used to be and try some home-made cheese.</p>
<h3>Discover Ribno and Radovljica</h3>
<p>The area around Ribno is characterised by peaceful villages and old rural houses - the Sava Bohinjka river quietly meanders through. An interesting walk will take you from the Sava Bohinjka river to the Talež Hunting Lodge where you get a great view of Bled and the Karavanke mountains. A little further afield, Radovljica is the Slovenian capital of beekeeping - it's an authentic town, with charming old centre where buildings have been preserved from the 16th Century. The locals make exceptional chocolate and it's widely known as the culinary centre of the Julian Alps - not to be missed if you love food.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Bled</h3>
<p>With the backdrop of the peaks of the Julian Alps and Karavanke mountains, its picturesque castle and bright blue waters, Bled's setting couldn't be any more charming. The best way to explore all of this, is on foot. Stroll the lake edge, hike up to the best viewpoints, and follow the trails that meander between the best sights and points of interest, through meadows and forests, and along streams and rivers. There's around 77 kilometres of trails to explore, and plenty of pretty villages and viewpoints along the way.</p>
<p>In Slovenia, walking routes are marked either red or yellow - yellow are the thematic trails and red are the mountain trails. Around Bled there's around 42 kilometres of red-marked trails and 35 kilometres of yellow-marked trails with a mixture of routes available for all abilities. Nearby Bohinj, or the pretty town of Radovljica offer further walking opportunities meaning there's lots easily accessible.</p>
<h3>Inghams guided walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included Inghams guided walks per week, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge and the company of other guests. Pre-booking is essential - check out the Guided Walks section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
