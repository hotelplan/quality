  <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Nestled in the Pyrenees, Arinsal provides a quiet base for exploring the local walking trails</li>
<li>Head to Andorra La Vella, with plenty of shops on the shopping mile or, wander the old quarter</li>
<li>With well-marked walking trails – you’ll be able to explore the local area on foot</li>
</ul>
<p>The mountain village of Arinsal drapes itself along a valley in the north-west of Andorra, not far from the Spanish border. The forested slopes of the Pyrenees close in on either side – a preview of the walking and cycling territory that’s the highlight of a summer holiday in this neck of the woods. Back at base, the restaurants and cafés are as international as their clientele. For a change of scene, hop on a bus to La Massana and its family-friendly adventure park or head to the capital city of Andorra La Vella. </p>
<h3>Walking in Comapedrosa Nature Park: the top of Andorra</h3>
<p>Comapedrosa Nature Park lies just north of Arinsal, where you can hike marked paths to high mountain waterfalls, lakes and forests – all watched over by Coma Pedrosa itself which, at almost 3,000m tall, is Andorra’s highest peak. For a walk with a hearty mountain food finale, climb through forests and along a ravine to a stone-clad mountain refuge called – you guessed it – Comapedrosa.</p>
<h3>Summer holidays exploring La Massana and the Ordino Valley</h3>
<p>Arinsal is the last village up one of the two valleys above La Massana. Just 15 minutes bus ride away from Arinsal you'll find La Massana, a bustling village where the gondola (operates on selected dates) goes up to the treetop ropes courses and playgrounds of a mountain top park. Bike tracks are also up here and range from smooth sidewinding paths to bumpy backcountry trails.</p>
<p>If you prefer boots to bikes, follow the river valley from La Massana to the start of the Camí Ral d’Ordino footpath. It’s an easy 6km trail connecting valley villages, wooden bridges and churches. It also traces part of the Iron Route that follows the history of the forges and mines in this patch of the Pyrenees.</p>
<h3>Biking on the agenda?</h3>
<p>Whilst Arinsal is a walkers paradise in the summer, some may be interested to hear that there are hundreds of bike-friendly routes and roads around Arinsal but particularly in the nearby town of La Massana, with rentals ranging from road bikes and MTBs to e-bikes that help make long-distance rides achievable for more casual cyclists.</p>
<p>For those interested in sporting events, you may have heard of the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup that takes place every summer in the Vallnord bike park above La Massana. It’s impossible not to get swept along with the joy of the spectators, who travel from all over to watch cyclists speed down some seriously hair-raising trails.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in Arinsal</h3>
<p>Arinsal is a great destination for families with a range of activities on offer as well as a selection of hotels with family-friendly facilities available. Kids will love the Mountain Park in the nearby town of La Massana, you catch the gondola up the mountain and at the top there are numerous games and activities. There are also plenty of walking trails in the area that cater to different abilities so if you're after family friendly walks or a bit more of a challenge then there's plenty to keep you on the trails.</p>
<p>The hotels in Arinsal also have great facilities for kids, the hotel <a data-udi="umb://document/593372d46b494271b5961e7eee5fdd70" href="/{localLink:umb://document/593372d46b494271b5961e7eee5fdd70}" title="Hotel Princesa Parc &amp; Spa">Princesa Parc</a> even has an on site bowling alley (additional charge), great fun for all the family.</p>
<h3>Europe’s highest capital: Andorra La Vella</h3>
<p>The capital city of Andorra la Vella is a 30-minute bus ride away from Arinsal and a great day-trip to enjoy its lively summer atmosphere. Wander the stone-walled old quarter to see Casa de la Vall, the seat of one of the longest-running parliaments in Europe, and past the handsome St Esteve Church. The riverside park is a lovely walk too. Restaurants, stylish spas, including the Caldea spa which is the largest thermal spa in Southern Europe and the famous tax-free Shopping Mile also offer a break from the trails. Once a month, Mercat de la Vall hosts local craftspeople selling everything from homemade sweets and aromatherapy oils to screen-printed t-shirts and jewellery.</p>

  <experienceMore><![CDATA[<p>A natural playground in the Pyrenees - the peaceful resort of Arinsal is great for families looking for adventure in nature.</p>
<h3>Family walks in Arinsal</h3>
<p>The hiking paths are really well marked in Arinsal, you’ll find information on the difficulty of trails and accessibility – great for families wanting to carefully plan out their routes. You’re also right on the doorstep of the Comapedrosa National Park where you’ll find forests, lakes and waterfalls – children can keep their eyes peeled for local wildlife such as lizards, deer and marmots (just be sure to keep a safe distance and leave nature undisturbed).</p>
<p>The “Salva la Serenalla” route is also great fun for families. It’s an easy walking route that follows the fictional story of a Serenalla lizard that’s become lost in the woods and needs the children’s help to find and rescue her. Along the route you’ll have clues to find the Serenalla as well as educational facts on the area – the route is around 2 kilometres long and the La Massana tourist office is able to provide more information on this route if needed.</p>
<h3>Water babies</h3>
<p>The Caldea spa in Andorra la Vella is around 30 minutes by bus from Arinsal and sits within an iconic building – recognisable as the large glass pyramid. Within Caldea there is an area dedicated to children of certain ages called Likids - great for children to splash around in or relax (there are refurbishment works planned during some months in 2024 so ensure you check opening dates and hours before visiting).</p>
<h3>Activity parks</h3>
<p>Not too far from Arinsal you'll find the Pal Arinsal Mountain park (open during selected months and some activities have age restrictions). It offers a number of activities for children including a mini pedal car circuit, electric train, archery, zip lines, rope parks and more.</p>]]></experienceMore>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Events and Festivals</h3>
<p>Please be aware dates are subject to change and should be checked in advance, tickets might also be required and may need to be booked and paid for in advance:</p>
<p>Mountain Bike World Championship - This event passes through Andorra every year and is usually held in July, normally in La Massana and Pal. There's a great atmosphere in the area and although the event doesn't directly take place in Arinsal, the town does get busier during this event. For summer 2025, the event is expected to take place in mid-July.</p>
<h3>Relax at the famous Caldea Spa</h3>
<p>Spa’s don’t get much better than the Caldea Spa. It’s one of the largest thermal spas in Southern Europe and just a 30-minute bus ride from Arinsal. Its iconic 80 metre high tower is the highest tower in Andorra. Head inside to marvel at the architecture and of course, enjoy the extensive facilities that were built to make use of the local hot springs. Mineral-rich water flows from the earth at 70ºC or you might want to try the ice pools if it's a warm summer day. The different areas and pools are plentiful with hydro massage jets, whirlpools, waterfalls and treatments available to book.</p>
<h3>Fun for all the family</h3>
<p>Arinsal is a great destination for families that love being out and about in nature, with plenty of walking trails to suit different abilities as well as local attractions to explore. The mountain park in La Massana is great fun with a miniature train, zip lines, bungee jumping, tubing and plenty more, it'll keep the kids entertained for hours.</p>
<h3>Walk across the Tibetan Bridge</h3>
<p>Don’t look down! The Tibetan Bridge is a architectural masterpiece sitting 158 metres above the Vall del Rui and stretching 603 metres wide. It’s a thrill seekers dream with incredible valley views on either side and a must-see on a summer holiday in Arinsal. The bridge is in Canillo and can only be accessed by the official Canillo bus or from the Roc del Quer viewpoint car park.</p>
<h3>Explore Comapedrosa Valley National Park</h3>
<p>Right on Arinsal’s doorstep is the Comapedrosa Valley National Park that's just beautiful in the summer. It's home to Andorras highest peak, Pic del Comapedrosa, which sits at 2,942 metres. The area is highly protected with a range of wildlife and nature spots including lakes, waterfalls and forests. There are a number of hiking routes to explore in the summer and three mountain refuges within the park, one of which offers light refreshments.</p>
<h3>Shopping haven</h3>
<p>If retail therapy is on your agenda then the lower tax rates here will be very welcome. Andorra la Vella has 'The Shopping Mile', which is partially pedestrianised. It begins in Avinguda Meritxell and passes all the way to Vivand. You'll find plenty of shops to browse with clothing, perfumery, sports equipment as well as electronics available to buy. The area also offers cafés and restaurants, so you can take a well-earned break from carrying the shopping bags.</p>]]></thingsToDo>

<h3>Why we love walking in Arinsal</h3>
<p>Arinsal is a hidden gem in the summer. Tucked away in the Pyrenees, it's a peaceful retreat and a paradise for walkers. Trails range in abilities from family-friendly walks to challenging hikes and with a reliable bus service you can easily reach neighbouring towns like La Massana to explore further. The walking routes are also some of the best marked trails we’ve seen in Europe with clear signage and many even offering QR codes that you can scan to find directions translated into numerous languages. With Andorra known for its many forests, mountains, lakes and wild life, we're sure you'll love walking here as much as we do.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
