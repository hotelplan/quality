<h2><a name="Itinerary"></a><span class="geolocation-title">Itinerary</span></h2>
<p><strong>Day 1: UK to Umbria</strong></p>
<p>Fly to <a data-udi="umb://document/57bc5f34b7074843b7f19f3fc6cb7ac4" href="/{localLink:umb://document/57bc5f34b7074843b7f19f3fc6cb7ac4}" title="Rome">Rome</a> Airport and meet with your tour escort. Transfer to your accommodation in Perugia, stopping off on the way to visit the stunning Marmore Falls. This impressive cascade of water is an engineering feat created by the Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus and is the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.</p>
<p>Meals included: Dinner</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Perugia</strong></p>
<p>Begin your first full day with a sumptuous breakfast, before meeting your knowledgeable guide for a tour of Umbria's capital, Perugia. Explore the historical centre with its maze of cobbled alleyways, elegant palazzi and picturesque piazzas. The town is surrounded by defensive walls that date back to the 6<sup>th</sup> Century. Your guide will help you uncover the hidden gems of this city steeped in history, leading you around National Museum of Umbria and its rich collections of art and artefacts. You’ll have free time to grab a bite to eat in Perugia, we’d recommend seeking out a traditional ‘torto al testo farcita’ Umbria’s answer to a freshly baked sandwich, stuffed with delicious fillings such as prosciutto or pecorino cheese (payable locally). In the afternoon move on to the hill top town of Deruta. The town is famed for its maiolica, the beautiful Italian tin glazed pottery, a style originating from the Renaissance. Wander through the colourful cobbled streets lined with small workshops selling the carefully patterned and glazed ceramics. You’ll have free time to visit the shops and perhaps find a souvenir to take home. After, you’ll be taken to Montefalco to visit the Arnaldo Caprai Wine Estate. You’ll enjoy a guided visit of the vineyards and a wine tasting. Learn about the traditional methods of wine making and sample the current vintages.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: Assisi</strong></p>
<p>Today you’ll visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site and medieval city of Assisi, framed by undulating <a data-udi="umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053" href="/{localLink:umb://document/15ea075a2eaf4537b6a6f77597d59053}" title="Umbria">Umbrian</a> hills. Meet with your local guide who will take you to explore the city of Saint Francis, who was born here in 1181 and is buried here. The Basilica of Saint Francis is a sight to behold, towering above the landscape and decorated with beautiful frescos. After your tour of the city you’ll have free time for lunch before going to the Tenuta Lunelli Il Carapace Wine Estate. Run by the Lunelli family, this is a unique place where wine and art meet. The fascinating domed building was designed by the Italian sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro as the first sculpture in which wine is produced. It is a tribute to the great wines of Umbria Sagrantino and Rosso di Montefalco, which you will learn about on your visit to the wine cellars.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Dinner</p>
<p><strong>Day 4: Montepulciano</strong></p>
<p>Another day, another Italian vineyard. Today you’ll reach <a data-udi="umb://document/ddef5c7c9bdb475792ae27614a6308b8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ddef5c7c9bdb475792ae27614a6308b8}" title="Northern Tuscany &amp; Montecatini">Tuscany</a> and the vineyards surrounding the medieval hilltop town of Montepulciano. This region has been producing wine since the early middle ages and is renowned for its excellent quality. You’ll be guided through the Tuscan hills to two different vineyards where the producers will tell you their stories, methods of production and the philosophy that is hidden behind every bottle. At the vineyard of Prugnolo Gentile you’ll taste Vino Rosso di Montepulciano DOC and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano DOCG, learning to recognise them and their unique flavours. At the end of the visit enjoy a light lunch, where you’ll sample some of the region's local produce. In the afternoon depart towards <a data-udi="umb://document/8502468fe6eb499faab16739425f51ec" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8502468fe6eb499faab16739425f51ec}" title="Siena &amp; Chianti">Chianti</a>.</p>
<p>Meals included: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: Pienza</strong></p>
<p>Those up for a truly unique and unforgettable experience can choose an optional excursion to hear the Benedictine monks early morning Gregorian Chants (departs at 5.45am). If you’d prefer that extra time catching up on sleep, you can begin the day slightly later and meet the rest of the group at about 90am for a guided visit of the stunning Abbey of Mote Oliveto Maggoire. Your guide will teach you about its fascinating history before a light breakfast with views of the Abbey. The rest of the day will be dedicated to art food and wine as you head to the town of Pienza. This is the birthplace of Pope Pius II, who transformed the once small village into the ideal Renaissance town. Today you’ll see examples of 15<sup>th</sup> Century architecture, a highlight being the Piazza Poi II flanked by the beautiful cathedral. Cheese lovers will be pleased to hear that the town is also known as the ‘capital’ of pecorino cheese. The milk from sheep that graze in the surrounding pastures of Val d'Orcia is used to make this delicious local delicacy that you’ll have the chance to taste during the tour. There will be free time for you to get yourself some lunch before some more wine tasting at a wine estate in Montalcino – land of the Brunello!</p>

<p>The Frescobaldi Castiglioni wine estate extends along the ancient Via di Castiglioni, built by the Romans to unify northern Tuscany and Rome. The area was already famous in those times for the quality of its agricultural harvests and was for centuries at the centre of heavy trade traffic and chosen as the site for luxury Roman villas. Today you’ll get an insight into the 700 years of wine making history that has taken place at this magnificent property. During your visit you’ll taste three of the wines that the Frescobaldi produce, accompanied by a small selection of cheeses. In the afternoon the trip will take you to San Gimignano where you’ll have free time to explore this beautiful town, nicknamed ‘ancient Manhattan’ because of its many towers.
