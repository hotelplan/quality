<p><span class="geolocation-title">Lapland in winter is a magical experience, a scenic winter wonderland located deep inside the Arctic Circle and blanketed in snow from December to April. Reindeer far outnumber people, and snow-laden trees form bizarre sculptures in the vast and silent landscape. At night you have a good chance to see the mesmerising Northern Lights shimmering in a star-studded sky. By day there are exhilarating reindeer, husky and snowmobile safaris as well as the more unusual activities of ice fishing, ice carting or horse-riding. Choose to spend the night in a thermal glass igloo or at the impressive Ice Hotel, which are on the bucket-list of activities for many of our guests.  Not forgetting the downhill and cross-country skiing of course. </span></p>

<h2><strong>When to go?</strong></h2>
<p>For some visitors the months of December and January are the most evocative. The blue twilight of ‘Kaamos’ envelops the arctic landscape and days pass in a palette of rose-coloured dawns and dusks. For others, it is the long sunny days of March and April. The daylight hours already outlast those back home. The snow crystals sparkle in the sunlight and nature is bathed in a surreal orange glow.</p>
<p>Whichever time you choose to travel, Lapland offers a refreshingly different experience for families and couples alike. We offer direct flights from a selection of different UK airports, short transfer times, and (of course) the chance to visit Santa.</p>

<h2>Sámi Culture</h2>
<p>Reindeer husbandry, fishing and hunting is still a way of life for the indigenous Sami people of Lapland. Their rich culture is known for producing beautiful jewellery and handicrafts. You will immediately recognise the distinctive, colourful clothing traditionally worn by the Sami. You can explore the fascinating Sami heritage at the Siida Museum and Northern Lapland Nature Centre in Inari, near <strong>Saariselka</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis)</h2>
<p>The Northern Lights are one of the most magical natural wonders of the world. The swirling light show in the sky is a major draw for many of the visitors to Lapland. The decade long solar cycle, which influences the Aurora Borealis, peaked in 2014 and the spectacular displays are set to continue for this winter. The local Sami people have a strong relationship with the Northern Lights, which they believe to be the spirits of their ancestors.</p>

<p>The Glass Igloos are unique to Lapland. The heated, glass ceiling igloos are the ideal way to experience the beauty and majesty of the Arctic late at night.
