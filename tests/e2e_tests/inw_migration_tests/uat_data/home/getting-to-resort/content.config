<h3>Getting there:  France – Vite!  Vite!</h3>
<p>With a choice of flights from 13 airports across the British Isles, including Heathrow, Jersey, the Isle of Man and Belfast, we've made it really easy at this end to fly to France to ski.</p>
<p>What's more, nine of our French resorts can be reached by flying to Chambery, chopping up to 90 minutes off the transfer time from Geneva airport.</p>
<p>For an even shorter French coach ride to your resort, let the train take the strain by travelling in style on our direct Eurostar service from London to Moutiers or Bourg St Maurice. Overall it's a longer journey than flying, of course, but it is extremely relaxing with no baggage restrictions, less queuing and more freedom to stretch your legs, and transfers at the other end can be short like the half-hour drive to <a data-udi="umb://document/870730cefeb2441dab9ccfec19c2fe88" href="/{localLink:umb://document/870730cefeb2441dab9ccfec19c2fe88}" title="Meribel">Meribel</a>.</p>
<p>For added convenience, in our traffic-free French resorts Inghams will do the work for you once you get there. Once you arrive in <a data-udi="umb://document/799f63184c52477c94171a057c16e540" href="/{localLink:umb://document/799f63184c52477c94171a057c16e540}" title="Avoriaz">Avoriaz</a> for example, you simply take a short stroll to your apartment or chalet and we will deliver your luggage.<br />And to top all this off, Inghams has a good range of ski-to-the-door accommodation spread across our 18 French wintersports resorts.  More information on ski holidays in <a data-udi="umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bd152c97eb204c59a0ae4a5b65e2c1e5}" title="France">France</a></p>

<h3>Getting there: Italy</h3>
<p>Your best bet for an Italian ski resort with a short transfer is probably <a data-udi="umb://document/bfccaf52eb4c47f09ae3657298234fda" href="/{localLink:umb://document/bfccaf52eb4c47f09ae3657298234fda}" title="Cervinia">Cervinia</a> which is less than two hours from Turin airport.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of the mighty Matterhorn, this is one of the highest resorts in the Alps with runs up to a whopping 3,900 metres. It's pretty stylish place too, so you can combine altitude with attitude.</p>
<p>From the contemporary architecture of <a data-udi="umb://document/799f63184c52477c94171a057c16e540" href="/{localLink:umb://document/799f63184c52477c94171a057c16e540}" title="Avoriaz">Avoriaz</a> to the chocolate-box charm of <a data-udi="umb://document/957b02edc6d846dfb4b2a1b2d1a3222d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/957b02edc6d846dfb4b2a1b2d1a3222d}" title="Morzine">Morzine</a>, the area offers variety to suit all tastes.</p>
<p>We've got a good selection of hotels here, including two chalet hotels slap bang in the centre of town.

<h3>Getting there: Austria</h3>
<p>For starters we fly from nine UK airports. And once you land, did you know that every single one of our Austrian resorts is no more than a two-hour drive away, and most an hour or less? The shortest transfers of the lot are to Seefeld (30 minutes) and Kühtai (40 minutes), and even big names such as St Anton, Kitzbühel and Mayrhofen are only 60 minutes by road from the airport.</p>
<p>Hotel location is so important to save time getting to and from the slopes, and in Austria we have lots of accommodation with doorstep skiing. Our top five are:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Chalet Hotel St Christoph, <a data-udi="umb://document/415e45d2352b4e61b39f1f3f2a9ec53d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/415e45d2352b4e61b39f1f3f2a9ec53d}" title="St Christoph">St Christoph</a></li>
<li>• Hotel Edelweiss &amp; Gurgl, <a data-udi="umb://document/6063ab813f384ab795dc6aa1d337f576" href="/{localLink:umb://document/6063ab813f384ab795dc6aa1d337f576}" title="Obergurgl">Obergurgl</a></li>
<li>• Hotel Schweizerhof, <a data-udi="umb://document/062150112b514663b32ca2bf633f2bed" href="/{localLink:umb://document/062150112b514663b32ca2bf633f2bed}" title="Alpenhotel Kitzbühel">Kitzbühel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The country has state-of-the-art lift systems and not many queues so wherever you are you should be up the mountain in no time.</p>
<p>Special mention must go to <a data-udi="umb://document/3c3783ff0696436cb752c8195e705dec" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3c3783ff0696436cb752c8195e705dec}" title="Ischgl">Ischgl</a> where you'll find a system of moving walkways and lifts carved into the streets so you don't have to walk far with your skis anywhere in resort!  And to <a data-udi="umb://document/4449c10aa6834800bdfa1f1806a57e96" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4449c10aa6834800bdfa1f1806a57e96}" title="Obertauern">Obertauern</a>, accessible via SZG airport  – where all our hotels are a stone’s throw from the nearest lift.

<h3>Getting there: Switzerland</h3>
<p>A choice of flights to Switzerland from 12 British airports - including Jersey and the Isle of Man - means less time travelling from home at the start of your holiday.</p>
<p>Many of our flights are scheduled, including both BA and Swiss from Heathrow to Geneva and Zurich, plus Swiss from Birmingham and Manchester to Zurich. Swiss is the only airline to offer free ski carriage, and for most of our holidays using these two airlines we also offer the 'Swiss Fly-rail Luggage' system which will take your luggage direct from your departure airport to your accommodation so you do not have to carry it with you!</p>
<p>For added flexibility, on our BA/Swiss routes to Zurich we offer daily departures allowing 'Flexi-Stays' for any duration from  3 to 14 nights on dates that suit you - this covers many  the Swiss resorts of <a data-udi="umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df}" title="Davos">Davos</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0}" title="Klosters">Klosters</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/f6cb1f0178b7447488bbf36b5f109fbc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f6cb1f0178b7447488bbf36b5f109fbc}" title="Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55}" title="St. Moritz">St Moritz</a> (where you currently get a free lift pass included) and new for winter, <a data-udi="umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50}" title="Saas Fee">Saas Fee</a>.</p>
<p>A good programme of charter flights from regional airports into Geneva serve the Valais resorts of <a data-udi="umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f1003f9fd15e4187b02398fa5c12dc50}" title="Saas Fee">Saas Fee</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4abc3d9367fc4903a52b296414b05ef1}" title="Zermatt">Zermatt</a> and Verbier as well as the Jungfrau Region. With charter flights, coach transfers are included often with a rep on board to quiz and get the low down on the resort before you arrive!</p>

<h3>Getting there: by train to Switzerland</h3>
<p>Swiss railways have a great reputation for efficiency and beautiful scenery, and for many of our Swiss holidays overseas transfers by rail, adding a super extra dimension to your holiday.</p>
<p>For other Swiss resorts where a coach transfer is included from Geneva, you have the option to upgrade to scenic rail transfers for only £50 return. Rail transfers are included for all our holidays via Zurich to the resorts of <a data-udi="umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df" href="/{localLink:umb://document/a95de5322c984f85bcf0f013c457e8df}" title="Davos">Davos</a>, <a data-udi="umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b23ef1df250240c5a3657f721fdb96d0}" title="Klosters">Klosters</a>, and <a data-udi="umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cc17fe79ccd1491a92608658d3af9d55}" title="St. Moritz">St Moritz</a>.</p>
<p>Rail all the way from St Pancras is also available for those who prefer not to fly. Sit back and relax on the Eurostar, followed by the TGV from Paris to join the Swiss transport network. It's excellent value and often means you can get an extra half day skiing on your last day!</p>

<h3>Getting there: Canada</h3>
<p>Skiing on the other side of the Atlantic is an experience that really should not be missed.</p>
<p>Of course, it takes more time to reach North America than to hop over to the continent, but it won't necessarily take as long as you think to get to the slopes: our shortest flights are to Montreal, and then it's just an hour-and-a-half by road to terrific <a data-udi="umb://document/cc094a7f49b04e9a845adc78e3c77f10" href="/{localLink:umb://document/cc094a7f49b04e9a845adc78e3c77f10}" title="Mont Tremblant">Tremblant</a>, Quebec's premier ski resort.</p>
