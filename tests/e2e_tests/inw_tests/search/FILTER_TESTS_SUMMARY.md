## 📁 Delivered Test File

### `searchExposedFilters.spec.ts` ✅ WORKING
**Purpose**: Core filter presence verification and basic functionality
**Status**: ✅ All tests passing
**Features**:
- Verifies all 9 filters are present and visible
- Confirms search results are found

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### Browser Exploration Findings
Through MCP Server exploration, discovered:
- **Search Results Structure**: `.hotel-card` containers with hotel details
- **Filter Interaction**: Dropdown menus with "Confirm" button required
- **Rating System**: 1-5 star checkboxes in filter dropdown
- **Search Results**: Hotel name, rating, location, pricing, "View details" button

### Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Modal Interference Issue** 🚫
   - **Problem**: `<div class="c-modal c-modal-mask filter__modal">…</div>` blocks filter clicks
   - **Solution**: Added modal detection and Escape key handling
   - **Status**: Partially resolved for basic tests

2. **Search Result Counting** ✅
   - **Problem**: Original method expected results, failed on empty searches
   - **Solution**: Created flexible `getResultsCount()` with multiple selectors
   - **Implementation**: `.hotel-card` primary, fallback selectors available

3. **Filter Locator Accuracy** ✅
   - **Problem**: Placeholder locators didn't match real page structure
   - **Solution**: Used MCP Server exploration to identify actual selectors
   - **Result**: Accurate targeting of filter buttons and options

## 📊 Page Object Model Integration

### Successfully Integrated With:
- ✅ `SearchResultPage` class for navigation and search
- ✅ `environmentBaseUrl` for QA environment testing
- ✅ Existing test patterns from `searchPagination.spec.ts`
- ✅ Cookie handling and modal management

### Custom Helper Functions Created:
- `getResultsCount()` - Flexible result counting with multiple selectors
- `verifySearchResultsStructure()` - Validates search result card anatomy
- `verifyRatingInResults()` - Confirms rating elements in results
- Modal handling utilities for robust filter interaction
