  <description><![CDATA[<p>A summer holiday in Seefeld offers a little bit of everything. Its plateau location means lots of sunshine and plenty of circular rambles round dense forests, Alpine meadows and picturesque mountain lakes, with distant views of spectacular limestone peaks. Everyone from leisurely strollers to keen summiteers will feel at home.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/3f32fab330a14ae18553f33680421135" href="/{localLink:umb://document/3f32fab330a14ae18553f33680421135}" title="Seefeld" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Seefeld walking deals</strong></a></p>
<h3>A walking holiday in Seefeld</h3>
<p>Walkways cling to the rock walls in the gorges of the Geisterklamm and Gleirschklamm, and turquoise waters rush through the narrow crevices below, having spent years carving unique formations into the rock.</p>
<p>The Karwendel and Wetterstein mountains that frame the plateau are a dream come true for adventurous hikers. The Rosshütte lifts climb up towards the limestone peaks of the Seefelderspitze and Reitherspitze, where the routes are rugged and more of a challenge – the views from the top make the climb worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Discover summer holidays in Seefeld: A mountain town with character</h3>
<p>There’s a bustling atmosphere in Seefeld in the summer, especially on Tuesdays when it comes alive for market day. The parish church of St. Oswald is a famous pilgrimage site and the 500-year-old monastery next food brew the best beer on the high plateau. The <span>Seekirchl chapel (also called Heiligkreuzkirche) is the region’s most iconic landmark and took 37 years to build, finally getting completed in 1666.</span></p>
<h3>Summer activities in Seefeld: From cycling to wild swimming</h3>
<p>A refreshing dip in a mountain lake is welcome on a sunny day, and Seefeld has plenty. Möserer See is a secluded lake in an idyllic location surrounded by forest and rumoured to be the warmest in the region, and the Wildsee, just outside Seefeld, is popular for families and sunbathers.</p>
<p>For keen cyclists and families, hundreds of kilometres of gravel roads and cycle paths weave in and out of the trees and meadows.</p>
<h3>Visit Innsbruck</h3>
<p>Innsbruck is a lovely city to visit in the summer. From the town centre, trains whisk explorers in all directions. It's easily discovered in a day – stroll around the historic old town with quaint streets, baroque architecture and the famous Golden Roof. Or, take the cable car up to the Nordkette mountain to see the city from above.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Seefeld with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Seefeld's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</span></p>

Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</span></p>]]></description>

<li>Requires hiking experience, sure-footedness and a good head for heights</li>
</ul>
<p>A panoramic high altitude hike that takes in two summits. Starting from the top of the Seefelderjochbahn this incredible hike summits the Seefelderspitze (2,220 metres) and the Reitherspitze (2,373 metres). After around three hours of tricky walking, including the mountain peaks, you'll reach the Nördlinger Hütte which is a beautiful mountain hut with amazing views. After enjoying some well earned refreshments, the walk to the top of the Härmelekopfbahn takes about an hour. Return to Seefeld on the lift.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standseilbahn (mountain railway/funicular)</li>

  <tagline><![CDATA[On Tyrol's high mountain plateau, Seefeld is an old farming village turned popular summer holiday spot, brimming with life and walking opportunities ]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Experience the local culture and festivals</h3>
<p>Seefeld is a town brimming with life in summer with weekly Tyrolean evenings and open-air concerts at the band stand. Immerse yourself in the local culture by visiting during a festival like Strudelfest, Almabtrieb or the Annual Village Festival. Try local food in the many high quality restaurants or head to the Klosterbrau Grill for some home-brewed beer. Tuesday is market day in Seefeld and the town square comes alive with food, drink and craft stalls.</p>
<h3>Explore on two wheels</h3>
<p>With over 570 kilometres of trails, you can explore the natural landscape of the Seefeld plateau and surrounding villages by bike really easily. Families will love the beginner routes, and keener mountain bikers can try some bike-and-hike routes that will get you really high into the spectacular Karwendal mountains. If you prefer your biking less strenuous, hire an e-bike and allow the battery to take the pressure off your legs as you enjoy the stunning views.</p>
<h3>Activities for the whole family</h3>
<p>Open the children's eyes to the mountain wilderness and help them develop an interest in the natural world. Discover child-friendly walking routes and themed trails, have fun on mountain adventure playgrounds, or make a splash in the outdoor swimming pools. Children will love it here just as much as you will.</p>
<h3>Take a refreshing dip in the mountain lakes and pools</h3>
<p>Enjoy the peaceful location of the idyllic Möserer See lake or, head to Mittenwald in Bavaria where you can walk to Lautersee and Ferchensee, two stunning bathing lakes. At the Wildsee, there's two swimming options including a heated outdoor pool and swimming lake. Families with young children will also love the leisure pools in Seefeld, with slides and children's areas.</p>
<h3>Climbing in the Karwendel and Wetterstein mountains</h3>
<p>With a strong, 100-year tradition of climbing in the region, Seefeld is a real hotspot, both for pros coming to take on the iconic Chinesische Mauer - a sheer rockface with more than 170 routes - and beginners just starting out. The Flämenwandl climbing area is a family-friendly location with more than 20 routes. As well as the climbing, there’s seating and a BBQ area, right next to the rushing Leutascher Ache River.</p>
<h3>Visit Innsbruck, the capital of the Tyrol</h3>
<p>Only 30-40 minutes from Seefeld, you can easily enjoy a day soaking up the culture in Innsbruck. Head to the old town where the architecture and narrow streets take you back in time. See the Golden Roof and the Ambras Castle, or head just out of town to the Swarovski Crystal World. Innsbruck hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964 and 1976, and you can visit the ski jump and enjoy the stunning view from the top. Or head up the Nordkette mountain and see the spectacular Inn valley from above. </p>]]></thingsToDo>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Seefeld and the surrounding area. There's plenty of places in Seefeld to buy walking equipment or you can rent pole from <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.kirchmair-seefeld.at/sporthaus/verleih.html" target="_blank">Kirchmair Sports Shop</a>. The <a data-udi="umb://document/c69e08cfc7374ae38110a395368d917d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c69e08cfc7374ae38110a395368d917d}" title="Hotel Seefelderhof">Hotel Seefelderhof</a> offers guests staying there free rental of rucksacks and Nordic walking poles, or if you stay at the <a data-udi="umb://document/47bfc01ba56f4a36aa7aa279a2e561dc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/47bfc01ba56f4a36aa7aa279a2e561dc}" title="Krumers Post &amp; Spa Hotel">Hotel Krumers Post</a> you can borrow walking poles for free.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 410 or Kompass Map 26 for Seefeld and the Karwendal mountains, which have a scale of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000. The maps show the hiking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
