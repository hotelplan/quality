  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hiking boots or dinner suits? In Kitzbühel, you can pack both. Come summer, the snow disappears from this famously luxurious ski resort – but the boutiques, swish hotels and Michelin-approved restaurants remain. Walking holidays to Kitzbühel look further than the cobbled streets to the 1,000 kilometres of marked paths that trail between the mountain pastures and panoramic routes of the Kitzbüheler Alps and Wilder Kaiser mountain ranges. Walking isn’t the only way to explore this great outdoors. There are also 800 kilometres of off-road cycling, via ferrata, paragliding schools, canyoning and paddle boarding lakes… and a summer diary filled with festivals and concerts.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/8c8b7abb379f45f09d279f2ab7c1dbeb" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8c8b7abb379f45f09d279f2ab7c1dbeb}" title="Kitzbuhel" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Kitzbuhel walking deals</strong></a></p>
<h3>Walking in Kitzbühel: Kitzbüheler Horn and Hahnenkamm</h3>
<p>A gondola climbs the Kitzbüheler Horn mountain on the eastern side of town. Get off at the midway station for trails up to the summit – or jump on Gipfelbahn (summit lift) to get to the top effort-free. There’s an alpine flower garden up here too with 400 species of high mountain plants, including the beloved Austrian edelweiss. Elsewhere, walking paths take wanderers to waterfalls, valleys, pastures and forest tracks dotted with mountain huts serving traditional specialities. On the other side of town, the famous Hahnenkamm mountain for more walking trails and fantastic views.</p>
<h3>Wild swims at Lake Schwarzsee</h3>
<p>The black lake of Schwarzsee, on the north-western edge of Kitzbühel, is a popular swim spot surrounded by trees and a nature reserve, the jagged limestone peaks of the Wilder Kaiser Mountains in the distance. The deep colour is down to the minerals in the water – said to be a balm for bathers’ skin. The temperature helps too; waters can hit a toasty 27°C. Rent a stand-up paddleboard or rowing boat and enjoy some peace and tranquility on the water.</p>
<h3>Discover Kitzbühel old town</h3>
<p>Take to the streets of the old town for a stroll along cobblestone roads lined with buildings painted in wildflower hues. This is a pedestrianised zone, so cafés and bars relax out onto the streets. It’s easy – and lovely – to spend a day dipping in and out of churches, museums and galleries… although you might have to factor in more time for popping by the likes of Louis Vuitton and boutiques full of chic mountain wear. As for dinner: will it be a candle-lit banquet at a Michelin-starred restaurant or a no-nonsense bowl of dumplings and an elderflower fizz on a terrace?</p>
<h3>Summer holidays in Kitzbühel</h3>
<p>Kitzbühel doesn’t hit the snooze button when the busy ski season is over. Instead, it lines up a series of film and food festivals, classic car rallies, mountain biking celebrations and marathons. A market pops up every Saturday too, with stalls piled high with handmade jewelry, mountain sausages and cheese, and orchard fruits. For explorations further afield, head to Kitzbühel railway station, where trains make tracks for Innsbruck in an hour and <a data-udi="umb://document/31b86014d3b04c3da584cc56dca63c66" href="/{localLink:umb://document/31b86014d3b04c3da584cc56dca63c66}" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> in two – or make the most of our excursion program to explore more of the area with ease.</p>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<h3>Recommended equipment</h3>
<p>Comfy walking boots, sun cream, insect repellent, waterproofs, rucksacks and walking poles are useful for hiking around Kitzbühel and the surrounding area. There's plenty of places in Kitzbühel to buy walking equipment<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.kirchmair-seefeld.at/sporthaus/verleih.html" target="_blank"></a>.</p>
<h3>Walking maps</h3>
<p>We recommend Mayr Map 455 for Kitzbühel and the surrounding area, which has a scale of 1:25,000. The maps show the hiking routes which are numbered and match the yellow signposts around the area. They will have a key which will help you understand the nature of the hiking trail before you set out on your walk.</p>
<h3>Walking guidelines</h3>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Austrian Emergency Services: 112</li>
<li>Mountain Rescue: 140</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
