  <description><![CDATA[<p>Caniço is more charming than a chocolate on a pillow. It’s much quieter than Funchal, so if you want to switch off a bit and explore the island – this is the place for you.</p>
<p>There’s a small square where you can have a look around the lovely shops and restaurants. Go a little further down to the coast for the promenade to get sea views and sunny bathing platforms.</p>
<p>Love diving and snorkelling? You’re in the perfect spot…</p>
<h3>Water babies, walk this way </h3>
<p>The Garajau Partial Natural Reserve is a marine reserve that was set up to keep underwater life thriving. You’ll be dropping into crystal-clear waters to see giant manta rays and the dusky grouper – among many others. </p>
<h3>Pop to the top</h3>
<p>The Cristo Rei lookout point never fails to impress – there’s the incredible view but you’ll definitely be getting your phone out for a shot of the dramatic Cristo Rei statue.</p>
<h3>Basecamp for exploration </h3>
<p>Caniço makes a great base for exploring the island and having somewhere relaxing to come back to. If you get the urge to pick up the pace, you can take a quick trip to Funchal for all the perks of city living – there’s a super reliable bus which makes it easy to get to.</p>
<h3>Make the most of the great outdoors </h3>
<p>There’s a huge amount of activities in Madeira so choose what takes your fancy – the Levadas walking trails, boat trips, dolphin watching, festivals, events and lots of lovely local food.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Caniço with Inghams?</h2>
<p>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Caniço include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</p>
<p>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Madeira's best walking routes and activities at your own pace.</p>
<p>Plus, we've included two optional guided walks every week in Madeira. Join a professional walking guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<h3>Public Transport</h3>
<p>If you’re staying in Caniço, there are regular buses to get you to Funchal, the journey takes around 20 minutes and is reasonably priced, all our hotels in Caniço have bus stops located near-by. </p>
<p>If you’re looking to explore different parts of Madeira then we recommend booking onto some of our excursions to see more of the island as the bus service outside of the local Funchal area is less reliable and hard to navigate.</p>]]></gettingAround>

Planned routes are subject to change. Any times, distances and ascents/descents stated are approximate. Full details of the walks with the meeting points and routes will be provided to you on arrival. In some instances there may be a small charge for local transport that is payable locally.

Where we cannot confirm your preferred option in resort, we will endeavour to offer an alternative subject to the above conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>Please ensure you are comfortable with the grade of walk, planned distance covered and terrain before booking. The decision of the guide on the suitability of the walk for you is final and no compensation will be paid where the guide believes, in their professional opinion, that it is not suitable. Please ensure you are well-equipped for the walk have suitable clothing and footwear. Walks are not recommended for guests under 12 years.

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">A quiet sanctuary just a short journey from Funchal</strong></p>
<p>Caniço might be a quiet town but you'll have the best of both worlds with a peaceful, coastal location yet you're just a short bus ride from all Funchal has to offer. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Make the most of Caniço's coastal location</strong></p>
<p>Dive, snorkel or paddle in the crystal clear waters of the Garajau Partial Natural Reserve, it’s a real gem of the area as its one of the most protected marine reserves in Portugal. You won’t be disappointed, marine life thrives here and if you thought the landscape was impressive on land then you’ll no doubt love the natural wonders in the water.</p>
<p>For those looking to stay on land you can still appreciate the blue waters set against the dramatic cliffs of Caniço. An impressive statue, called the Cristo Rei Statue is perched on the cliffs, it can be a little tricky to get here, its a very steep walk from Caniço so a taxi may be your best option, whilst here you'll also find Garajau beach which can be accessed by cable car. Take a journey down to the pebbled beach, dip your toe in the water and enjoy the natural reserve.</p>
<p>To admire more of Caniço's coastal views you can also stroll along the promenade. The views are wonderful and the path hugs the coastline allowing you access to some small pebbled beaches along the way.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Delight in the flowers of Madeira</strong></p>
<p>For those that love all things flora and fauna then Madeira is a paradise. Its mild climate caters to tropical flowers, green covered landscapes and plants of all shapes and sizes. From town centres to nature spots, flowers are found across the island, think blue agapanthus swaying in the breeze whilst the purple beaked birds of paradise bathe in the sun. For those wanting to discover these tropical delights then one of our hotels situated in Caniço, the <a data-udi="umb://document/13f581d48ab540af80b7e9f149ab1508" href="/{localLink:umb://document/13f581d48ab540af80b7e9f149ab1508}" title="Quinta Splendida">Quinta Splendida</a>, has 30,000m² of Botanical Gardens to explore, it’s a special property with lots of history and the gardens are magnificent, with endless plant species to gaze upon.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to head a little further out of Caniço then go to Funchal and take a ride on the cable car that whisks you up to Monte where you’ll find beautiful botanical gardens as well as the Monte Palace tropical gardens. The Monte Palace has scenic paths to explore whilst you pass by tropical plants, water channels and cascading fountains, it’s a colourful, floral display set in the hills of Funchal.</p>
<p>Festivals in Madeira don’t get much better than the annual flower festival which is held in either April or May. The streets of Funchal become free of traffic but full of festivities with parades passing by, dancers adorned in floral creations and of course, plenty of plants and flowers to see. It’s a lively event that encapsulates the islands pride and love of flowers.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Admire local monuments</strong></p>
<p>The statue of Christ the King of Garajau (but often termed the Cristo Rei statue) can be found on the cliffs of Caniço looking out across the ocean. You may want a taxi to get there from Caniço's centre but the views aren’t to be missed with the Atlantic Ocean in front of you and the Garajau Nature Reserve below. This incredible monument dates back to 1927 and if that doesn’t impress you then the views will.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Hop to another island</strong></p>
<p>We love the small and charming pebbled beaches near Caniço but if you want to feel the sand between your toes then beaches don’t get more beautiful than on the island of Porto Santo. It’s a bit of a journey to get there (around 2 hours 30 minutes by ferry) but it’s worth it, with a nine kilometre stretch of golden, sandy beach and clear blue waters it’s no wonder it’s been voted one of the best beaches in Europe. Those golden sands aren’t just easy on the eye either, they’re said to have therapeutic properties making Porto Santo a popular day trip for those in search of health and wellness. Ferries only operate one outbound and one inbound departure from Funchal per day so booking and paying in advance is advised, make sure you plan your trip carefully.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Culture seekers head to Funchal</strong></p>
<p>For those in search of museums or galleries then your best bet is to head to Funchal where you’ll find a variety of museums on offer. One of the oldest museums you can visit is the Museum of Sacred Art, positioned in Funchal and found within a 16th Century Palace with an enviable collection of Portuguese and Flemish art. Another museum where you’ll also find a great collection of painting, sculpture, furniture and ceramics is the Casa Museu Frederico de Freitas, this pretty building holds many unique pieces.</p>
<p>For something a bit different you can also find the 3D Fun Art Museum, which, as the name suggests, is a bit of light-hearted fun, step into the paintings and make yourself part of the masterpiece. Football fans will no doubt love to visit the CR7 museum, honouring Madeira’s own Cristiano Ronaldo. The museum details his football career and you can even see some of the many trophies he’s won.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Enjoy Madeira's calendar of events</strong></p>
<p>Madeira offers a busy events calendar. From the Madeira roller Marathon to classic car events, there’s lots to enjoy. Please be aware that some events are ticketed and may need to be booked and paid in advance, event dates are approximate and should be checked before booking. Here are a few of our favourite events listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Madeira Flower Festival, usually held in either April or May – Arguably Madeira’s most iconic festival, experience the parade, the flower carpets or the Wall of Hope amongst many other celebrations taking place across the event.</li>
<li>Carnival, usually held early to mid-February: Take in vibrant costumes, music and dance on the small parades travelling through the streets of Funchal and other events taking place across the city</li>
<li>Madeira Rum Festival, usually held around mid-April: You’ll find local rum producers at this event along with a lively atmosphere and maybe even the chance to taste the product</li>
<li>Madeira Classic Car Revival, usually held at the end of May: Car lovers and non-car lovers will enjoy this event, some of the best classic and vintage cars are brought in from across the region for spectators to marvel over</li>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Each day, a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Caniço</h3>
<p>We love Caniço as a base for walking, with most levada walks a short journey away. Here, you have a quiet coastal location just a bus ride from the city of Funchal and all there is to do there. Caniço caters to everyone, you can relax and wander through the town taking in the incredible views, or travel a little outside Caniço and walk along the traditional levadas. </p>
<p>The trails and Levadas are what make Madeira a truly unique destination for walking – the mountains make for some fantastic scenery along the way and the mild year-round climate doesn’t hurt either. From Caniço you’re only a short journey from some of the nearby levadas but we always recommend walking with a professional guide as starting points can be hard to reach and routes can be difficult to navigate so it’s always good to have an expert on hand. You can also join an included guided walk. You get two included with your holiday but if you’re looking to do more, no problem, head to our excursions to see what additional walks you can join (extra charge).</p>
<h3>Guided Walks</h3>
<p>Don't forget, you have the option to join two included guided walks per holiday, with a local, professional guide. Get to know our favourite walking trails with insider knowledge. Pre-booking is essential - check out the <a data-udi="umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063" href="/{localLink:umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063}" title="Guided Walks">Guided Walks</a> section below for more information.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
