  <description><![CDATA[<p>Perching on the Italian slopes of the mighty Matterhorn - or Monte Cervino as the locals call it - is the little town of Cervinia. This is where Italy meets Switzerland, very easily visited during the day thanks to the lift network linking Cervinia to Zermatt. From its high glaciers - where you can ski, even in summer - down to its main street lined with bars and restaurants, Cervinia has been on the map for hiking, climbing, biking (and skiing) for over a century. And for good reason…</p>
<h2>Alpine Crossing and the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</h2>
<p>The brand new Cervinia-Zermatt Alpine Crossing - the highest cross country gondola in Europe, links Testa Grigia in Italy to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise in Zermatt. This is big news for the area and a long time coming as the idea for the Alpine Crossing was conceived 80 years ago! At the top, there’s a 360° viewing platform, a ‘glacier palace’, fine dining, ski slopes, plus hiking and biking trails. With wheelchair access, it’s accessible for everyone.</p>
<h2>No better place for a family trip</h2>
<p>It being Italy, and Italians loving children as they do, Cervinia is <em>perfetto</em> for a family holiday. On top of the outdoor space and activities - easy walking routes, fun biking trails, rafting and the kids’ snow park (even in summer!) - there are also fairy-tale castles to explore. And let’s not forget this is the land of pizza, pasta and gelato - every childs’ favourite food.</p>
<h2>The ‘blue lake’ - or Lago Blu, should we say</h2>
<p>Half an hour’s walk from Cervinia is Lago Blu with its deep turquoise colour. Walk around the small lake to catch it from the right angle and see the Matterhorn mirrored in its clear waters. Not far away are the Layet Lakes, three pozze (or ‘puddles’) of spring water, all different hues of blue-green, that overlook the valley.</p>
<h2>Through the Aosta Valley: Cammino Balteo</h2>
<p>Here’s one for the hard-core hikers: hiking the Cammino Balteo (or perhaps just a section or two…). This is a circular itinerary of around 220 miles which can be split into 23 stages (4-6 hours each) through the entire Aosta Valley, with its lakes, nature reserves, waterfalls, pastures, vineyards, ancient fortresses and castles. Most of the walking is gentle, and not too high-altitude, so dipping in and out of the full circuit and official route is a good option, even with kids in tow.</p>
<h2>Why book a summer holiday in Cervinia with Inghams?</h2>
<p><span>At Inghams, we do walking holidays differently. With no fixed itinerary, you have more time in your destination and the freedom to walk as much or as little as you like, discovering some of Cervinia's best activities at your own pace. </span></p>
<p>Plus, from 2024 we've included two optional  <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://document/419dea98f6194619b18de27172090063" href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/walking-holidays/guided-walks" target="_blank" title="Guided Walks">guided walks</a>  every week in Cervinia. Join a professional mountain guide and really get to know the area (see more details in the ‘walking’ tab below).</p>
<p><span>With over 85 years of outdoor travel experience, our holiday packages to Cervinia include flights, transfers, and accommodation, so you can relax and leave the small details to us. Our experts can help you choose the best holiday for you, and our team in resort can give you the inside scoop on how to spend your time away with us.</span></p>]]></description>

  <gettingAround><![CDATA[<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Lifts</strong></p>
<p>There are a few lifts open in the summer which will take you up to some fantastic walking areas and viewpoints. The lifts in Cervinia are open from around the 24th June to the 10th September.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matterhorn Express - goes up to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</li>
<li>Plateau-Rosà cable car</li>
<li>Plan Maison cable car</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you check out the brand new Zermatt-Cervinia Alpine crossing. This lift heads from Cervinia's Testa Grigia at 3,458 metres all the way to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise at 3,821 metres, where you'll be able to hop on the new connection; it's a great way to explore two countries in one day!</p>]]></gettingAround>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The walking in Cervinia is so good that every route could be classed as a favourite, but here are just a few routes that we really love:</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Mont de l'Eura - Rifugio Oriond<span>é</span> - Plan Maison</strong><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>14.6 kilometres</li>
<li>approx. 5 hours 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a circular route with a steep climb up to the Duca degli Abruzzi Oriond<span>é refuge where you can break up the walk with a drink and something to eat. It's quite a hike up to Plan Maison but well worth it. This is a really popular trail and for runners and hikers and has views to die for!</span></p>
<p><em>The Rifugio Oriondé is usually open between July and September.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Diga del Goillet</strong><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate hike</li>
<li>6.6 kilometres</li>
<li>approx. 2 hours 45 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the Goillet dam on this walk from Breuil-Cervinia. It's a man-made lake and has the most striking blue colour. The terrain can be uneven and loose so a comfy pair of walking boots are imperative. This is a good walk to do on a clear day as you may be able to see the Matterhorn reflected in the lake!</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Bec Pio Merlo - Grandes Murailles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate to Challenging hike</li>
<li>7.9 kilometres</li>
<li>approx. 3 hours 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>A popular trail as there are so many things that you can do on the route; lots of people set up camp here and go bird watching. This is a great route if you're looking for picture perfect Matterhorn views and want to spot some local wildlife. It can be quite rocky in parts and doesn't have much shade, so make sure you bring a hat and comfortable walking shoes. </p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Bontadini - Rifugio Teodulo</strong><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Challenging hike</li>
<li>7.9 kilometres</li>
<li>approx. 3 hours 31 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Hike to one of the first ever alpine refugi, built in 1852. All the way up at 3317 metres it's a really cosy and welcoming place for a pit stop and has fantastic views of the Matterhorn. This is a challenging route and so you won't find many other people on the way. Ideal if you want some peace and quiet!</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">More great walking route inspiration</strong></p>

  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Get up to speed with downhill mountain biking </h3>
<p>Cervinia's full of bike parks, mountain biking tracks and intense downhill circuits if you want to challenge yourself. It's a really popular mountain-biking area with over 1,000 kilometres of dirt tracks and specially made trails. The free-riding in the Val D'Aosta is some of the best with loads of uphill climbs and downhill descents and a good mix of woodland and farm routes. For easy access, you can take your bike up in many of the gondolas. </p>
<h3>Summer Skiing</h3>
<p>One of the coolest things about Cervinia, is that you can ski most of the year round. It's high altitude and it has a glacier which means that there's even snow in the summer. Break up your hiking days and swoop down the glacier instead. Even in the summer there are 25km worth of ski slopes on the Plateau Ros<span>à where you can go up to 3883 metres. This is where many world cup ski teams train all year round. You'll have a brilliant time playing around in the Snowpark Zermatt, which is the the biggest freestyle area on a glacier.</span></p>
<h3>A visit to ancient Aosta</h3>
<p>An hour’s drive from Cervinia, and a beautiful one at that, is the Roman city of Aosta. One for the history buffs, Aosta dates back to 25BC. Walk through the Arch of Augustus inside the city walls to discover the subterranean ‘cryptoporticus’ and forum, the Roman theatre and burial ground, as well as medieval arches, bridges and ruins. Along winding lanes, cobbled streets, and in hidden nooks and crannies, you’ll find charming local restaurants and shops selling everything from salami to traditional wooden tankards.</p>
<h3>Delicious local food</h3>
<p>All of this activity will definitely build up an appetite so you're lucky to be on the Italian side of the mountain. The food is delicious and hearty with your classic Italian dishes, like pasta and pizza but also a fantastic selection of regional food. Fontina is the most famous cheese from the region and is rich, creamy and nutty and tends to be used for raclette or fondue. Check out the restaurant <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.ristorantebricolebricolette.com/" target="_blank">La Bricole</a> while you're there, the food and atmosphere are fantastic!</p>
<p><span>A few examples of dishes from the Aosta Valley include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Polenta alla rascard -</strong> grilled </span><span>slices of polenta topped with a beef and sausage ragout and fontina cheese.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Capriolo alla valsostana -</strong> stewed venison and vegetables in a herby cream and served with a grappa sauce. </span></li>
<li><span><strong>Fresh water mountain trout -</strong> sometimes stuffed with ham, topped with fontina cheese and poached in wine.</span></li>

  <usefulInformation><![CDATA[<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Recommended equipment</strong></p>
<p>If you're going to be testing out the more challenging vertical walks and Nordic Walking then we'd highly recommend renting some adjustable walking poles and getting some decent walking boots. Warm jackets are also important if you're spending your days hiking at high altitude. Don't be fooled by that summer sun.</p>
<p style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Walking maps</strong></p>
<p>We'd recommend the Kompass 87 map if you want an overview of the Breuil-Cervinia-Zermatt area and the variety of trails around it.</p>
<h4 style="color: #00533a;"><strong>Hiking guidelines</strong></h4>
<p>The mountains are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers:
<ul>
<li>Italian Emergency Services: 112</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails or go onto a glacier without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>]]></usefulInformation>
