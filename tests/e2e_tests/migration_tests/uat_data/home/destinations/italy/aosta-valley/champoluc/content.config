  <description><![CDATA[<p>The mountains around Champoluc are fantastic in the summertime. Ask any local and they'll tell you that summer is the best season! Champoluc's small French town vibes bring people back year on year. They can't get enough of the local cheese, wine and endless walking opportunities. It's like stepping into a real life re-enactment of Russel Crowe's <em>A Good Year</em>. If you're looking for a slower paced walking holiday, where you can really get to know the local way of life and taste the typical food, then this is the place for you. </p>
<h2>Champoluc, a town for locals</h2>
<p>Everyday in Champoluc becomes more familiar. You'll leave with the feeling that you've known it all your life. Just walking along the river you'll find endless hidden gems, from the intricate wood carvings that line the riverside path, to public barbeque spots sitting in little wooded coves. There are always youngsters and locals barbequing and having a great time - giving the town its communal feel. All the hotels in this area have a really welcoming and cosy atmosphere, it's like a home away from home.</p>
<h2>Wildflower flecked fields</h2>
<p>The pretty village of Champoluc is made more so by the Evançon River that runs through it, with its electric-blue glacier melt. During the summer months the wildflowers will be in full bloom, freckling the meadows with delicate pastel colours. At some points it feels like you've stepped into a painting by Monet. It's not all about the views on the ground though, if you look up you'll find yourself surrounded by some very unique mountains, each with wonderful shadowing on them. When the sun hits them in the right place, they'll emanate a glow which brightens up the whole valley.</p>
<h2>Earn your lunch on a Val d’Ayas hike</h2>
<p>Hike to an alpine hut that just so happens to be home to the highest elevation cheese cellar in Europe - what an accolade! The 9.4km Tchavana walk should take two to three hours and, best-of-all, ends at agriturismo La Tchavana. It not only has one of the best views of the Monte Rosa glacier but a restaurant serving local dishes, and a shop selling cheeses and cured meats to bring home or to eat on your mountain-side picnic. The Monte Rosa massif stretches from Switzerland into Italy and its peaks reach up to 4,600m - that’s the second highest in Europe after only Mont Blanc. This high-altitude terrain means there are incredible hiking trails, as well as mountaineering around the glacier, making Champoluc a great base if you’re looking for a challenge.</p>
<h2>The Family Feeling</h2>
<p>Champoluc is a deceptively tranquil town, because when you look closely you'll find heaps of activities popping up. The little archery school on the riverside is great fun for an hour or two of entertainment. Alternatively, head into the woods just off the main town and you'll find an adventure ropes course and paint-balling. Every now and then an outdoor games area pops up, free for anyone to come along and enjoy. It's called 'Giochi della Nonna', Granny's Games - this is a throwback to all the wooden board games that were played in the past and a great way to get children off their iPads. Drop the children off and head to the golf course which spans over a lawn near the river - make sure you watch out for flying balls though!</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>The walking in Champoluc is so good that every route could be classed as a favourite, but here are just a few routes that we really love:</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Lago Blu </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk </li>
<li>Duration of hike is 4 hours  </li>
<li>Lago Blu lake sits at the bottom of the Monte Rosa mountain </li>
</ul>
<p><span>Starting from Saint Jacques, the walk is easily accessible from Champoluc. Walking up through the hills, passing through ‘Fiery’ a small mountain village. As in the name of the walk, the Lago Blu is the star of the show and a popular tourist spot. Burrowed between the sky, glaciers and moraine, you'll find the Lago Blu with its glacial water which is an incredible deep blue colour- a sight not to be missed!</span></p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Lochian Lake </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk   </li>
<li>Can access hike by foot or bus </li>
<li><span>Beautiful view of the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Lochian Lake hike is known as Champoluc's trail of excellence. Starting from the centre of Champoluc, you'll head through the foothills of Monte Rosa to a remote hidden gem - Lake Lochian. Look out for the Castore, Polluce and Roccia Nera glacier observation points - they're the best places to take in the views and snap that perfect shot for Instagram.</p>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore the area at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #00533a;">Why we love walking in Champoluc</strong></p>
<p>From famous glaciers to glimmering lakes and alpine woodland, you'll never get bored walking around Champoluc. Each day is an adventure with a different type of scenery to discover every day. If you head to the Blue Lake you can stop for a spot of sun-bathing or if steeper climbs are your thing, head up Monte Rosa, which is the second highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe. Champoluc's definitely a hidden gem when it comes to active, nature-filled summer holidays!</p>
