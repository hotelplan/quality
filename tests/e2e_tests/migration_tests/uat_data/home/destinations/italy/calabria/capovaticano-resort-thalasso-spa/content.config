  <description><![CDATA[<p>We love staying at the Capovaticano Resort Thalasso &amp; Spa – it has an incredible beachfront location with jaw-dropping sea views. You can even see the nearby Aeolian islands. The hotel’s been done in a modern style and feels really relaxing. There’s plenty of space to spread out including by the pool that stretches along the beach front. Grab a book and head here to top up your tan. A handy pool bar serves drinks all day. The beach in front of the hotel is just for its guests so you can use the loungers and parasols that have been set up on the sand. We recommend taking a dip in the sea, Calabria has some of the clearest waters we’ve seen. If you want to get active then you can play tennis, rent bikes or try out some watersports right at the hotel.</p>
<p>The location of the hotel is nice and peaceful but it’s quite easy to get out and explore Calabria. The popular town of Tropea is 10 kilometres away and well worth visiting for the day. It’s a historic town on the cliff edge with great views, family-owned shops and characterful bars and restaurants. There's a shuttle there from the hotel that you can use for a small fee.</p>
<p>Transfer time: approx. 1 hour 20 mins by private car from Lamezia airport.</p>]]></description>
