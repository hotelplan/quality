  <description><![CDATA[<p>This enchanting Vecchia Masseria Agriturismo, full of Sicilian character, is run by the Golino family who have lovingly restored the farmhouse of this rural complex. The Agriturismo is set within the archeological nature reserve of the Ganzaria Mountains, in <a data-udi="umb://document/aafdbd88af954166b49b0bd7fa839f19" href="/{localLink:umb://document/aafdbd88af954166b49b0bd7fa839f19}" title="South East Sicily">South East Sicily</a>. The family have a passion for the food and wine that this beautiful landscape produces, making this the perfect place for people who share an interest in outstanding food, excellent local wines and stunning natural surroundings. There are walks and bike rides in the surrounding hills and views across the countryside to the sea in the distance. If you’re looking to relax, head to the large pool terrace where you can rest in the shade of the surrounding palm trees or to really unwind take a dip in the hot tub. It’s also a great base for sightseeing as its not far from Piazza Armerina (approx. 45-minute drive) and the UNESCO World Heritage sight of Villa Romana del Casale, with its incredible collections of Roman mosaics.</p>
<p>The beautiful rustic stone buildings, that date back to 1856, were once accommodation for the rural farm workers. These buildings have been carefully restored, using environmentally friendly materials and techniques, and converted into comfortable guest rooms. The Agritourismo has retained its authentic Sicilian character with its delicate craftsmanship, Sicilian coto tiles and wrought iron embellishments. Enjoy lovingly prepared Sicilian delicacies created by Cavaliere Stefano Golino the owner and chef de cuisine. Dine in the rustic restaurant and taste the flavours of the surrounding landscape, most of the food used in the cooking is seasonal and freshly grown at the property.</p>
<p>Car hire is recommended for this hotel. Vecchia Masseria Agriturismo is approx. 1 hour 15 mins from Catania Airport</p>]]></description>
