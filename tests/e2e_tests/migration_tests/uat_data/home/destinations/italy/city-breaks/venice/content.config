  <description><![CDATA[<p>Arriving in Venice by vaporetto, the skyline appears like a mirage of gleaming palaces and marbled piazzas. On closer inspection, you’ll find that it’s more like a maze – and the loveliest of places in which to get lost. St Mark’s Square and the Grand Canal draw the crowds (and then some), but the most interesting finds are often the time-worn backstreets and bridges that pass pocket-sized cafés and shops hung with Venetian masks. Islands speckle the surrounding lagoon, each touting their own specialty, from Murano’s glassblowing workshops to Burano’s lace shops. Or, there’s always Venice Lido – home to Venice Film Festival.</p>
<h2>Walk around aimlessly: getting lost in Venice</h2>
<p>You’ll discover some of the best walks in Venice by ditching the maps and apps and seeing where your feet take you. One turn off the tourist trail are streets strung with washing lines and quiet canals dotted with bàcari – bars serving up delicious Venetian small plates called cicheti.</p>
<p>Cannaregio, the northernmost neighbourhood, is free of the crowds found elsewhere. Listen to the stories of the Jewish Quarter, seek out Tintoretto’s grave at the Madonna dell’Orto church, and sit on the fondamenta and watch gondoliers go by – preferably while digging into a bowl of spaghetti-like bigoli.</p>
<h2>Exploring Venetian masterpieces</h2>
<p>It’s little wonder that the top spots in Venice are so popular; they’re just as beautiful as rumour (and Instagram) has it. St Mark’s Basilica is a masterpiece of painted ceilings and gilded icons. The Campanile bell tower offers a bird’s eye view of the vast square below. The Grand Canal’s oldest bridge, the Rialto, arches elegantly over the water, while the baroque Bridge of Sighs is carved with solemn faces. Gallerie dell’Accademia houses masterworks and ever-revolving exhibitions by famous faces like Anish Kapoor.</p>
<p>One of the perks of spending a walking holiday in Venice is that you can saunter around these places when what’s left of the cruise ships have departed and the crowds have thinned. Just make sure to book your entry tickets in advance to skip any queues.</p>
<h2>The islands and beaches of the Venetian Lagoon</h2>
<p>Vaporetti water taxis dart between Venice’s many docks and the islands of the lagoon. Catch a boat to Murano to marvel at the masterful glass blowers or to Burano to wander canals framed by a rainbow of houses.</p>
<p>Venice Lido – an 11km-long sandy spit at the mouth of the lagoon – offers a total change of scenery. Hotels line the water’s edge at Lido town, the host of the Venice Film Festival. It’s been a red-carpet escape for the rich and famous for a good few hundred years, with Liberty-style hotels stacked along the beachfront. The southerly village of Alberoni is a relaxing finale. This nature reserve is heaped with sandy dunes best explored by foot or bike.</p>
<h2>Lake Garda, Florence and Rome</h2>
<p>Venezia Santa Lucia train station is your gateway to the rest of Veneto. Go to Treviso (20 minutes) for quieter waterways and some great chances to sample the local Prosecco. Peschiera – the southernmost town of <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a> – is 1.5 hours away by train, opening the Italian Lakes to water-loving wanderers. How about another city with a romantic reputation? <a data-udi="umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/41229767036d47f28a27ac846e23458b}" title="Verona">Verona</a> (1 hour 10 mins) and <a data-udi="umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8b79e45930f145f6b156a9152415fa9b}" title="Florence">Florence</a> (2 hours 10 mins) both make easy day trips. You can even reach Venice train station in style – by vaporetto.</p>

  <tagline><![CDATA[The canals, golden squares and waterside palaces of Venice are a labyrinth for curious wanderers – only hinting at the islands and Prosecco vineyards beyond]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<p><strong>Piazza San Marco</strong></p>
<p>Home to the Basilica di San Marco, the Torre dell’Orologio and the Doge’s Palace, Saint Marks Square marks the heart of Venice and you’re bound to be drawn to it in no time. The square has a great energy about it always buzzing with people and plenty to see and do.</p>
<p><strong> Basilica di San Marco</strong></p>
<p>It’s one of the most visited sights in the city for good reason! The Basilica is a beautiful example of Byzantine architecture with its five teardrop domes. Its lavish decoration and intricate gilt mosaics have lead it to be nicknamed the Basilica d’Oro or Golden Basilica. It originated as the chapel of the Doge and became the resting place of Saint Mark in 829. The ornate decorations are in part thanks to a law passed by the Doge in 1075, which required all ships returning to Venice to bring back something precious to decorate the basilica. Spot the spot the “modern” mosaic designs by the likes of Titian and Tintoretto, as you explore this architectural masterpiece. These designs replaced some of the originals between 1500 and 1750.</p>
<p><strong>Harry’s Bar </strong></p>
<p>Harry’s bar has been a popular watering hole for artists, writers and aristocrats since 1929. The home of the original Bellini, Harry’s bar is where Giuseppe Cipriani invented the delicious combination of prosecco and pureed white peaches in 1948 and named it after the 15th century artist Giovanni Bellini.</p>
<p><strong>Murano</strong></p>
<p>Learn about the elite pursuit of the glassmaking artisans of the Venetian Republic with a trip to the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. You’ll find glass-lined streets, factories and shops selling the famous colourful glass. Weekday mornings are the best time to catch the glass blowers in action.</p>
<p><strong>The Venetian Ghetto</strong></p>
<p>This was the Jewish quarter of Venice from the 16th to 19th centuries. Originally, a getto (foundry) it became the living quarters of the Venetian Jewish community. The law restricted them to this district at night and during Christian Holidays. With growing numbers of people and limited space, the buildings grew taller, housing synagogues and publishing houses. It wasn't until Venice joined with Italy in 1866 that full emancipation was gained for the Jewish people of Venice. However, this was short lived with many fleeing before the Nazi occupation. Today, the Jewish Museum brings to life the tumultuous history of Venetian Jews by sharing their stories. The Jewish quarter is a vibrant site of Jewish history, with a distinct Jewish population still living here. Wander through the streets lined with synagogues, restaurants and bakeries.</p>
<p><strong>Venice Lido</strong></p>
<p>The Venice Lido is a small island in the Venetian lagoon which has lovely beaches and great views of the city. Take a break from city life and find a spot on the 11 kilometre coastline. There’s a public beach to the north (come early to get a good spot) or you can choose from one of the paid private beaches.</p>
<p><strong>The Bridge of Sighs</strong></p>
<p>Known as the Ponte dei Sospiri in Italian, the covered bridge passes over the Rio di Palazzo and links the Doges Palace to the Prigioni, the prisons built across the canal in the 16th century. Hence the name, the bridge of sighs, it’s the last thing the prisoners would see before being incarcerated. As you pass beneath, spot the ten faces that decorate its baroque exterior, only one is smiling. If you visit the Doges Palace you can actually cross the bridge, but the best views are from the water.</p>
<p><strong> Peggy Guggenheim Collection</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve had your share of Renaissance and are looking for something more contemporary, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection is the place to go. It offers a more modern roster of works by mostly European artists from Picasso to Matisse, curated by the eccentric American heiress in the mid-20th century. Think cubism, futurism and surrealism. The gallery's artsy café is a great spot for a tea or coffee break.</p>
<h3>Local food &amp; drink to try</h3>
<p><strong>Bigoli</strong> is the city’s signature pasta. This fat spaghetti is made with buckwheat and duck eggs and served with anchovies and onion.</p>
<p><strong>Spaghetti</strong> <strong>in nero di sepia</strong> is a striking pasta dish is made up of slow cooked squid coated in a tomato sauce, infused with squid ink, giving it a rich black colour.</p>
<p><strong>Fritto Misto</strong> are tasty tangles crispy battered fish, calamari and shrimp. It’s usually served up in a paper cone.</p>
<p><strong>Cicchetti</strong> is Venice’s centuries old answer to Tapas. Head to a traditional bàcari (bar) for a selection of tasty snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Baccala mantecato</strong> is a classic cicchetti dish of slow cooked creamy cod with olive oil pm fresh crispy bread. Best served up with a cool glass of prosecco.</p>
<p><strong>Sarde in saor</strong> is a sweet-sour dish with fried sardine fillets marinated in vinegar, onions raisins and pine nuts. The dish dates back to the Middle ages when the fishermen would use this method to preserve the fish. Today you’ll see it on menus as antipasto or as an appetiser.</p>
<p><strong>Spritz</strong> ask for a 'spritz con Aperol e Campari' or a 'Spritz Misto' as it's known in some parts of Italy. This is a typical drink of the region. It's a slightly stronger and more bitter version of an Aperol Spritz - the Campari gives it a richer, more sophisticated flavour. Traditionally this should be served with a green olive in it. It's really delicious and definitely worth a try!</p>]]></thingsToDo>
