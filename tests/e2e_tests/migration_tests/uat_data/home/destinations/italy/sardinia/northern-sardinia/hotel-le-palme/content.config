  <description><![CDATA[<p>This traditional, Sardinian, whitewashed hotel is immersed an oasis of palm trees and Mediterranean plants, aptly named Hotel Le Palme. It’s in a lovely quiet location on the <a data-udi="umb://document/10879313b41b457bb9a2212bd1747034" href="/{localLink:umb://document/10879313b41b457bb9a2212bd1747034}" title="Northern Sardinia">Northern Sardinia</a> coast, not far from the famous resort of Porto Cervo.</p>
<p>The large pool has an organic shape that blends into the gardens. There’s lots of nice spots to sit out around it, with sun loungers dotted about. There’s also the hotels private beach area, just a short stroll from the gardens in a sandy inlet in Cala Pitrizza, where you can use the facilities free of charge. We loved relaxing here on the comfortable sun loungers and cooling off in the clear blue sea. The Gazebo Grill Bar is just between the pool and the beach and the brilliant bartenders will keep you refreshed all day long. They do really nice light lunches here. There's also a wellness centre on the propperty, so for a real treat, why not book yourself a massage or beauty treatment?</p>
<p>If you’ve had your fix of relaxation and you’re up for a fun activity or adventure, then just speak to the friendly hotel staff. They’ll be more than happy to recommend things for you to do in the area during the peak summer months, including water sports, boat trips, horseback riding, trekking and mountain biking (activities payable locally).</p>
<p>Wake up to a great spread at the breakfast buffet; eat out on the terrace and enjoy the views, you can even see the sea. When it comes to dinner, expect to be wined and dined in the Romantic Restaurant, where the chef creates tasty, beautifully presented Italian dishes. The perfect end to a perfect evening here involves live music (every night from June to September), with a cocktail in hand. </p>
<p>Car hire is recommended for this hotel. Hotel Le Palme is approx. 40 mins from Olbia airport.</p>]]></description>
