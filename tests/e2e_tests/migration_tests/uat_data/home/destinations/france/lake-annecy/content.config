  <description><![CDATA[<p>From the crystal clear waters of Lake Annecy - known as Europe’s cleanest - to the picturesque villages circling the lake and its surrounding mountains, visiting Annecy in summer is like having multiple holidays in one. Hit the water by paddleboard, pedalo, boat or wakeboard, head up into the hills for views and explore the winding cobblestone streets of Annecy before heading into one of its breweries, bistros or fine dining restaurants. At the far end of the lake is the peaceful Talloires, a village with an ancient history; ideal for escaping the action and discovering the area’s quiet side.</p>
<p><a data-udi="umb://document/5ceea04efdaf4f04ac2236a1128f55b0" href="/{localLink:umb://document/5ceea04efdaf4f04ac2236a1128f55b0}" title="Lake Annecy" class="c-btn"><strong>View all Lake Annecy walking deals</strong></a></p>
<h3>Lake Annecy’s summer beach scene</h3>
<p>As well as the city, lake and mountains, you’ll also get a taste of beach life on the shores of Lake Annecy, with over a dozen to choose from for a lazy day: Plage de La Brune and St Jorioz have sandy shores, while the Menthon-Saint Bernard is more of an outdoor swimming pool complex but in a natural setting and with fresh lake water, floating walkways, lifeguards and showers. Albigny beach, with its grassy sunbathing banks, is one of Annecy’s most popular, just a 20-minute walk from town. Or, make use of the public buses to take you to different spots around the lake. For some tranquility, the Talloires bay is sheltered from wind, with paddling pools for kids, as well as beach volleyball and bowls. The list goes on…</p>
<h3>From easy strolls to walking in the hills</h3>
<p>Wander along the meandering canals in Annecy’s old town and you’ll understand why it’s called the ‘Venice of the Alps’, packed with colourful houses and medieval architecture. Discover more about the flora and fauna of the lake along family trails Sentier des Roselières or Réserve Naturelle du Bout-du-Lac. And, if you’re feeling sporty, head high on the Parmelan pathway, or take the trail to the Glières plateau, for the full mountain-panorama effect.</p>
<h3>Visit the city of Annecy for a day of culture</h3>
<p>For a city, Annecy is tiny in size and easy to explore on foot; making it the ideal place for some sightseeing. From Annecy Castle, which dates back to the 13th century, to the Pont des Amours (lovers’ bridge) covered in padlocks, to 12th-century prison Palais de l’Ile, or exhibition space Bonlieu, Annecy is packed with history. When you’ve had enough history, dive into the food and drink scene. The seven Michelin stars in the region just go to show what a focus food is here, with the local bistros and caf<span>é</span>s serving up equally as excellent un-starred plates and great value Savoie wine. Join the locals in strolling along the lake’s edge to digest…</p>
<p>For another history hit head to Talloires, a village based around a 9th century abbey with a more recent history of artists and writers (we’re talking the likes of Cezanne and Mark Twain) who came to Lake Annecy in search of beauty and inspiration.</p>
<h3>Cycle the long but gentle lakeside bike path for the views, or head up high for a challenge</h3>
<p>Pedal around the lake on the mostly-flat 26-mile cycle path, or take out the hardest work and do it on e-bike. Serious riders can discover the numerous Tour de France stages that have passed by Annecy over the years, with Col de Leschaux a fantastic introductory climb. Mountain bikers will find their people at Le Semnoz bike park, with everything from fun trails to the long 1,300 metre downhill ride into Annecy.</p>
<h3>Waterfalls, gorges and rivers - perfect for excursions</h3>
<p>Beyond the lake are rivers and nature reserves to explore. The Angon waterfall gives beautiful views over Lake Annecy and can be accessed by a trail from Talloires on the eastern shores. West of Annecy, and just under the medieval castle of Montrottier, is the Fier Gorge - a narrow and deep canyon that you can access on foot thanks to a sturdy footbridge through the deep-cut rocks.</p>
<h3>Earn your lunch by walking to a mountain hut above Lake Annecy</h3>
<p>Head up into the mountains and make tracks for a mountain hut, for cooler weather, big views and an Alpine treat once you arrive. The Aulp de Marlens hut is at the end of a meandering trail through forest and alpine pastures, with homemade cheese waiting for you. The hike from Aviernoz to cliff-top Parmelan Hut might be a hard slog up (around two hours) but is well worth the effort for the views. And setting out from the shores of Lake Annecy towards Praz d’Zeures, you’ll have views of Mont Blanc.</p>

  <popularWalkingRoutes><![CDATA[<p>From easy strolls along the lake to more challenging rambles in the surrounding hills, Lake Annecy offers a range of walking opportunities for all levels. </p>
<h3>Le Semnoz</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Around 3 hours of walking</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a walk up to 1,699 metres, along the Bauges Mountain Range, catch a glimpse of the famous chamois (similar to a mountain goat) or admire the local flora and fauna, or just admire the view. You'll be able to see Mont Blanc towering over the mountains and even as far as the Chartreuse Mountains. Stop at a Reblochon cheese farm along the way.</p>
<h3>Historical walk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
<li>Around 45 minutes of walking</li>
</ul>
<p>Discover Talloire’s fascinating history dating back to the 9th century with this fascinating tour of the village.</p>
<h3>Cascade d’Angon</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate walk</li>
<li>Multiple routes available</li>
</ul>
<p>Cascade is French for Waterfall, and the Cascade d’Angon is a much-loved element of the local landscape. There are three ways up (or down) from Talloires and Angon and you can vary your walk by taking a different route to the waterfall, including some of the flat paths along the lake, to create a circular walk.</p>
<h3>Bout de Lac Reserve Naturelle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy walk</li>
</ul>
<p>This walk is a firm favourite, not only as it offers tranquility, rivers which source the lake, flora and fauna but also because it's flat. A circular walk through the Bout du Lac nature reserve can be combined with a visit to the beach where you can observe the landing of many of Lake Annecy’s paragliders. From the port just adjacent to the beach, pedalos, boats, and paddleboards are also available for hire.</p>]]></popularWalkingRoutes>

  <tagline><![CDATA[Beautiful Lake Annecy: surrounded by high mountains, charming villages and the historic city of Annecy]]></tagline>
  <thingsToDo><![CDATA[<h3>Walking through history: discover Lake Annecy's historic past</h3>
<p><span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">Visit the town of Annecy, known as the 'Venice of the Alps', its canals, the old town and historical churches. The most famous buildings are the </span>Palais de l’Isle and the Basilique de la Visitation above Old Annecy with a free exhibition of bells (usually from mid-May onwards).</p>
<p><span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">The area was also associated with the French Resistance, the British agent Odette operated locally and the story of the Plateau de Gli</span>è<span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">res, where resistance fighters were based and there was a big battle is told in the Resistance Museum. </span></p>
<p><span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">The village of Talloires on the Eastern side of the lake was built around an 11th century abbey. The most well known castles in the area were built by the </span>Dukes of Savoy including Annecy, Menthon-Saint-Bernard and Montrottier.</p>
<h3>Great for cycling</h3>
<p><span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">There's a flat cycle path around Lake Annecy and this scenic ride follows the outline of the lake with fantastic views across glistening water and towards pretty villages, castles and mountain peaks. The path also goes along to Albertville on an old rail track.</span></p>
<h3>For nature lovers</h3>
<p><span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">Visit the Bout de lac Nature reserve and follow the trail through the woodland, meadows and marshes, and there's even an old tower giving an elevated view. The paths in the hills around Talloires offer great intermediate hiking and a chance to discover summer-time Alpine nature at it's best. Visit the </span>Cascade d’Angon waterfall (30mins walk above Talloires Village) and the <span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">Roc de Chère Nature Reserve </span></p>
<h3>Roc de Chere Nature Reserve and Menthon Saint Bernard</h3>
<p>This impressive promontory above Talloires bay does not immediately look accessible for walkers, but it has trails throughout, a golf course, and a restaurant! A day out exploring the Roc de Chere and Menthon Saint Bernard is a great way to spend a day of your holiday. Menthon Saint Bernard is also home to the Chateau de Menthon, an 11th century gorgeous castle.</p>
<h3>Food &amp; drink</h3>
<p>There are many friendly and local caf<span>é</span>s to choose from, all offering good coffee with croissants, as well as beer and cold drinks. For bigger appetites, there are the La Savoyarde or Le Comptoir de Sébastien restaurants, located next to the local beach, and Le Club situated at the end of the village by the lake on the path to Angon.<br />There are a huge number of eating options, from humble to two Michelin stars, in and around the Lake and the city itself. It's also worth going to Annecy and catching the market on Fridays. Talloires also has a local market on <span class="first-childnth-child-oddonly-childnth-child-1last-child">Thursdays (usually held 19 June to 26 Sept).</span></p>
<h3>Summer festivals</h3>
<p>Lake Annecy has some great festivals throughout the summer season and we've listed a few of our favourites below. Please be aware that some events are ticketed and may need to be booked and paid for in advance, event dates are approximate and should be checked before booking.</p>

<h3>Hiking guidelines</h3>
<p>The lake and mountains surrounding Lake Annecy are a natural paradise, with lots to explore and discover. To help it stay that way, and remain an enjoyable and safe place for everyone, we recommend following our little list of do's and don'ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your route well and don't overestimate yourself</li>
<li>Check the weather forecast</li>
<li>Tell someone where you're planning to walk and what time you're expecting to be back</li>
<li>Take all the recommended equipment</li>
<li>Make a note of emergency numbers</li>
<li>Don't leave the marked trails without a guide</li>
<li>Let nature stay wild by not picking alpine flowers (it's illegal in some places) or getting close to/making contact with wild animals</li>
<li>Always leave gates as you found them and don't climb over fences</li>
<li>Leave no trace</li>
</ul>

  <walkingGeneralDescription><![CDATA[<p>On an Inghams walking holiday, you have the freedom to explore Lake Annecy at your own pace. Make each day a new adventure, with as much or as little walking as you like.</p>
<h3>Why we love walking in Lake Annecy</h3>
<p>It doesn't get better than the sound of water gently lapping against the shores, sweeping vistas and charming villages, Lake Annecy offers all the tranquility of lakeside living but is also home to the vibrant and historic city of Annecy. You can really enjoy the best of both worlds here and it's the same when it comes to walking. For those that prefer to stroll, take a wander along the lakes edge and stop at caf<span>é</span>s and swimming spots along the way or, for those up to the challenge, head for the mountains behind the lake where you'll get beautiful birds-eye views.</p>]]></walkingGeneralDescription>
