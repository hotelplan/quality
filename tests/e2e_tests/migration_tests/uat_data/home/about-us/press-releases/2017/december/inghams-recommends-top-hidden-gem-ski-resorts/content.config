<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Looking To Go Off The Beaten Track This Winter? <br />Inghams Recommends Its Top Five Hidden Gem Ski Resorts</span></p>
<p>As skiing continues to be a popular winter holiday choice for Brits, the ski slopes in some of Europe’s better-known resorts can often become overcrowded. Expensive prices can sometimes deter skiers from visiting the big name resorts and, with Brexit looming, value for money is becoming increasingly important to holidaymakers.</p>
<p>Ahead of the start of the coming ski season, specialist tour operator Inghams is recommending alternative resorts to escape to for unbeatable skiing and quieter pistes at a more affordable price tag:</p>
<p>Arinsal<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in Andorra’s Vallnord Ski Area (for Excellent Value</span>)        <br />Arinsal offers excellent value for money and is an ideal resort for families. Inghams offers a pre-bookable Ski Inclusive package, which includes a six-day lift pass, six-day ski and boot hire and lunch vouchers covering the cost of a sandwich, chips and drink in selected mountain restaurants, from £209 per adult and £104 per child (aged 6 - 15 years). The terrain welcomes beginner and early intermediate-level skiers, and the local ski school has an excellent reputation. For a true hidden gem, venture over to the Arcalis sector (via free shuttle bus) which is often quiet and normally has excellent snow conditions.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a seven-night holiday on a half board basis at the three-star superior Hotel Palarine from £619 per person, based on two adults and two children sharing during the Easter holidays (1 - 8 April 2018). Price includes return flights from London Gatwick to Barcelona and airport transfers. For more information and to book, visit www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays or call 01483 791114.</p>
<p>Bad Kleinkirchheim<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in Austria (for Quick Airport Transfers)</span>         <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span>Inghams’ new flight route from London Gatwick to Klagenfurt means that getting to Bad Kleinkirchheim (Inghams’ only resort in the region of Carinthia) is now quick and easy. This winter, guests will be able to reach the resort within an hour from leaving the airport, arriving with plenty of time to pick up their equipment hire, ensuring a hassle-free start to Day One on the slopes. The picturesque ski and spa resort is also home to Olympic Downhill champion and skiing legend, Franz Klammer, who has a local run named after him and who still hosts ski days on selected dates. The ski area offers ideal terrain for intermediates, with many long red runs down to resort level. Non-ski activities include winter walking, ice-skating, tobogganing and snowshoeing, and the four-star Hotel Trattlerhof offers a free torchlit walk for all Inghams guests with horses, mulled wine and hot drinks included.</p>
<p><br />Inghams is offering a seven-night holiday on a half board basis (including five-course evening meals) at the four-star Hotel Trattlerhof in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Austria, from £929 per person, based on two sharing, departing on 17 March 2018. Price includes return flights from London Gatwick to Klagenfurt and airport transfers, and guests who book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before 15<sup>th</sup> December 2017</span> will receive a FREE airport lounge pass per person. For more information call 01483 791 114.    </p>
<p>Kronplatz<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in Italy’s Dolomiti Superski Area (for World-Class Skiing)</span>        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span>The compact resort of Kronplatz is situated in a less-discovered part of one of the world’s biggest and most beautiful ski areas, the extraordinary Dolomites (1,220km). The local ski area is a short bus ride away from the more famous Sella Ronda ski circuit, meaning the pistes here are rarely over-crowded. The resort has a modern and efficient lift system, as well as an excellent ski school, meaning skiers and snowboarders of all abilities can really make the most of their time on the long blue and red runs. Seven hairy black runs also provide thrills for the more advanced skier. There are plenty of non-ski activities available too, such as tobogganing, snowshoeing, bowling, night skiing and sleigh rides.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a seven-night holiday on a half board basis (including complimentary afternoon cakes and fresh fruit from 3pm - 6pm) at the four-star Hotel Monte Sella from £769 per person, based on two sharing, departing on 6 January 2018. Price represents a saving of £210 per person and includes return flights from Bristol to Innsbruck and airport transfers. For more information and to book, visit www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays or call 01483 791114.</p>
<p>Arosa<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in Switzerland’s Graubunden Ski Region (for a Touch of Luxury</span>)  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span>Arosa is a chocolate-box village, surrounded by towering, snowy peaks, and is an ideal choice for those in search of a quintessentially Swiss holiday. The resort atmosphere is unique and unforgettable: although relatively unknown amongst the international ski market, it is a favourite of Swiss skiers and is much loved by the guests who visit. Sitting up high at 1,800m, Arosa boasts an excellent snow and sunshine record and its 225km of pistes attract intermediate skiers looking for plentiful red runs. Inghams guests can also arrive in style, via the impressively efficient Swiss rail system from Zurich.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a four-night short break, ideal for those wishing to sneak in a second ski holiday this season, on a half board basis (including five-course evening meals) at the four-star superior Waldhotel National from £1,079 per person, based on two sharing, departing on Wednesday 24 January 2018. Price includes return flights from London Heathrow to Zurich and airport transfers by Swiss rail. For more information and to book, visit www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays or call 01483 791114.</p>
<p>Les Menuires<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in France’s Three Valleys Ski Area (for Great Family Savings)</span>         <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span>Les Menuires, Inghams’ newest French ski resort, is a hidden gem within one of Europe’s biggest and best ski areas. At 1,815m, the fantastically-connected resort attracts skiers of all abilities as it provides some of the best access to the Three Valleys (particularly the more challenging runs down from La Masse) at a more affordable price tag. Les Menuires is a perfect resort for families, with almost all of Inghams’ resort accommodation being ski-in / ski-out, allowing for stress-free access to the slopes. A wide choice of hotels is on offer, from self-catering apartments to four-star luxury, but one of the best-value options is the ski-inclusive Village Club du Soleil. Children’s clubs and a great entertainment programme is included, alongside a FREE lift pass per person and FREE equipment hire.</p>
<p>Inghams is offering a seven-night holiday on a ski-inclusive basis (including buffet breakfasts, picnics or a buffet lunch and buffet-style evening meals with complimentary wine, as well as a FREE lift pass per person and FREE equipment hire) at the three-star Village Club du Soleil from £1,202 per person, based on two adults and two children sharing during the Easter holidays (7 - 14 April 2018).
