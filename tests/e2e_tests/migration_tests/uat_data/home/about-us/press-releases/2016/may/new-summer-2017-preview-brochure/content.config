  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><strong>Wednesday 4th May 2016, Godalming </strong>– With an increasing number of guests every year saying they do not want to be tied to set duration holidays, flexibility is the theme of Inghams <strong>Summer 2017 Preview Brochure</strong> which features a wider choicer than ever of holidays in over 100 resorts in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland flying from 23 regional airports.</p>
<p>Inghams now offer a range of durations from short 3 and 4 night breaks to 14 night holidays. As well as increased flexibility, Inghams report that guests want to <strong>‘See More and Do More’</strong> on holiday and the new brochure offers a host of suggestions on this theme ranging from the famous Verona Opera to local festivals such as the Almabtreib in Austria, when decorated cows descend to the valley.</p>
