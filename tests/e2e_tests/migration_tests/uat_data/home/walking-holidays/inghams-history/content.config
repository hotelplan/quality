  <bioContent><![CDATA[<p>Credited as the man who took Britain skiing, it didn’t take Walter Ingham long to realise his passion for the mountains went beyond skiing. In fact Walter’s passion was for all that the fresh air, stunning views and peaceful scenery had to offer when he was out in the mountains.</p>
<p>A few years after creating the Inghams company, Walter expanded from offering not only skiing holidays, but walking holidays too. Walter offered these throughout the summer months and today, Inghams carries on his enjoyment of walking by making sure you have the opportunity to walk to the best view points across Europe too.</p>]]></bioContent>
