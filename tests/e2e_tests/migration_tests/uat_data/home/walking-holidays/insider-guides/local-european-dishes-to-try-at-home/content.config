<h3>ITALY</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Savoury - Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13084362/adobestock_25737066-1.jpeg" alt="Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms" data-udi="umb://media/cdaa8311ed8348638ee23de23558221d" /></p>
<p>Keep it simple and tasty. This traditional Italian pasta dish doesn’t require many ingredients and can be whipped up in about 30 minutes. This dish originates from <a data-udi="umb://document/58d85ec0faa548b2ab580143fdc9b722" href="/{localLink:umb://document/58d85ec0faa548b2ab580143fdc9b722}" title="Tuscany &amp; Umbria">Tuscany</a> <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/italy/tuscany-umbria"></a>but is widely popular throughout the whole of <a data-udi="umb://document/4483b219b1754b70910d3f01f05be9be" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4483b219b1754b70910d3f01f05be9be}" title="Italy Holidays">Italy</a><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/italy-holidays"></a>.</p>
<p>We recommend Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms (add pancetta if you would like to add meat to your dish, however it’s tasty enough without) <span>This is the perfect dish to enjoy on a warm summers evening, just like those in Italy. </span></p>

<p><img src="/media/13084361/adobestock_328016056-1.jpeg" alt="Tiramisu" data-udi="umb://media/ce4c1074c48142b1a164f1de32d0efbc" /></p>
<p>Tiramisu translates as “Cheer me up”, and we promise it will! <span>It</span> is an authentic Italian recipe and is one of the most famous Italian desserts in the world born in Treviso, a lovely town near Venice.</p>
<p>It’s famous for a reason, it’s absolutely delicious. The triple threat of the 3 c’s, coffee, chocolate and cream make it an irresistible dessert, in our experience there’s always room for tiramisu. You can’t get more Italian than this delicious and traditional delight.</p>

<h3>AUSTRIA</h3>

<p>This authentic Austrian dish originates from the capital – Vienna. In <a data-udi="umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760" href="/{localLink:umb://document/c9325d9a77054a3c8190f3ab0da21760}" title="Austria">Austria</a> they are very particular that Wiener schnitzel is made using veal, however if you can’t get hold of any veal, then you can replace with chicken or pork - your secret’s safe with us!</p>
<p>This a real home comfort dish, a crowd pleaser for the whole family. The Austrians usually serve this with lemon slices, green salad and French fries.</p>

<p>Another home comfort from Austria’s capital, the classic apple strudel. Vienna is a haven of coffee shops all selling the most beautiful pastries, and apple strudel is not one to be missed. Best enjoyed with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla custard with a strong cup of espresso on the side.</p>
<p>It’s sugar and spice and everything nice. Give it a try at home</p>

<h3>SWITZERLAND</h3>
<p><strong>Savoury - Cheese Fondue</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13084363/adobestock_249391401-1.jpeg" alt="Cheese Fondue" data-udi="umb://media/6cac1f1a965b4cf0b29cbffd143b3ac8" /></p>
<p>One for the cheese lovers. This classic Swiss dish is typically enjoyed in the mountains after a long day on the slopes in <a data-udi="umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/92803bd348ec48c1b64d53e77931172d}" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. But what’s to stop you enjoying it in your home?</p>
<p>You could graze on this dish all evening. Accompanied with crusty bread to dip and a glass of white wine to sip. It’s actually suggested by the Swiss that you drink white wine with cheese as it helps with the digestion, whereas water, juice or beer will cause indigestion.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet – Swiss Roll</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13084364/adobestock_248915420-1.jpeg" alt="Swiss Roll" data-udi="umb://media/266d137db4d64877bc32d36a0b085f65" /></p>
<p>We had to make sure the famous Swiss roll was included on the list. However, despite its name, the Swiss Roll did not actually originate in Switzerland, it is believed to originate elsewhere in Europe. This cake is seemingly famous worldwide, even in places such as Indonesia, India and Japan.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect dessert to make for any occasion, choose from the classic victoria sponge, red velvet or chocolate, whatever tickles your fancy.</p>

<h3>FRANCE</h3>
<p><strong>Savoury - Tartiflette</strong></p>
<p><img src="/media/13084359/adobestock_99401798-1.jpeg" alt="Tartiflette" data-udi="umb://media/11b93026d7d74b0c83f2c6c9dde20db9" /></p>
<p>Tartiflette originated in Savoy in the <a data-udi="umb://document/20c1ee89e76c4eab9b98c48479361bdf" href="/{localLink:umb://document/20c1ee89e76c4eab9b98c48479361bdf}" title="France">French</a> <span>A</span>lps. It was purposely invented in an attempt to increase awareness of the Reblochon cheese. It’s safe to say that their plot certainly worked, as you will find tartiflette on every menu in the French Alps.</p>
<p>Let’s just say, it’s not a meal your doctor would recommend having every night, but certainly can’t hurt now and again<span>.</span> It is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons and onions and is oh so tasty. Just like the <span>c</span>heese fondue from Switzerland, this cheese heavy meal requires a crisp glass of white wine to help with digestion.</p>

<p>This is a really easy summer French dessert, it may sound fancy by the name (pronounced kla-foo-tee), however it is super simple to make and an absolute delight to taste.</p>
<p>This was recommended to us by our very own Rachel, who is the Area Manager in France throughout winter and summer, so we’re sure she’s done her research<span>.</span> You could be eating this melt in the mouth dessert in less than <span>one</span> hours’ time, what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>This dessert has become the symbol of Lake Bled in <a data-udi="umb://document/eb90f98d70e84089a8cb145d8e46e049" href="/{localLink:umb://document/eb90f98d70e84089a8cb145d8e46e049}" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/destinations/slovenia"></a>, also named the Bled Cream Cake. <a data-udi="umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e}" title="Lake Bled">Lake Bled</a> is actually the only place to get an original Kremšnita.</p>
