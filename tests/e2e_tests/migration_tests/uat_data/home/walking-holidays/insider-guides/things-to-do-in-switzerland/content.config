<p>It's a playground for bold explorers, tranquility seekers, and anyone who's ever daydreamed about the Alps. In this land of precision and punctuality, you'll find a delightful mix of traditional mountain villages, ice palaces, and, yes, the occasional yodel.</p>

<p>The Swiss transport network really is a marvel, whisking you to hidden waterfalls, breathtaking plateaus, and dramatic gorges. And back in the towns, you can breathe in the pure air, stroll along flower-laden promenades, and relax in lakeside cafés.</p>
<p>Switzerland is a tapestry of beautiful cities, magnificent mountain resorts, and cosy Alpine hideaways. You can't possibly see it all in one trip, but here's a roundup of the best things to do in Switzerland to get you started.</p>
