It was roughly 10 years ago when Giambattista, the latest member of the family to take over the business, saw the potential the grounds had to make some remarkable wines.<br /><br />They now produce a variety of Valpolicella wines made up of a variety of grapes including Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Oseleta, depending on the wine. <br /><br />The Amarone Della Valpolicella is a firm favourite, ruby in colour and you should be able to pick up cherry notes with a slight cinnamon spice. This wine can be paired with red meats and game or alternatively it can be enjoyed on its own as the sun goes down. <br /><br />You can also visit the <a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/blog/lake/bardolino-wine-festival/">Bardolino Wine Festival</a> which is an annual event in October where you can sample an array of local wines and cuisine alongside live music and other festivities. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> You will find the <a data-udi="umb://document/61458626ac434ffaac3fb17cd8a98c0a" href="/{localLink:umb://document/61458626ac434ffaac3fb17cd8a98c0a}" title="Hotel Catullo">Catullo Hotel</a> in the heart of the <a data-udi="umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1}" title="Bardolino">Bardolino</a>.

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/blog/lake/bardolino-wine-festival/" target="_blank">The Bardolino Wine Festival</a>, which takes place in late September and occasionally early October, celebrates the local grape harvest. The celebration includes the Enoteca, where expert sommeliers introduce visitors to the best Italian wines.</p>
<p>The festivities which take place along the magnificent <a data-udi="umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/59fcac55a66d4666ae4b0cca449364d1}" title="Bardolino">Bardolino</a> lakeside promenade includes music, dancing and fireworks.

It was founded in 1959, but production of these high quality wines didn’t start until 1963. <br /><br />The wines produced here benefit from the Mediterranean micro-climate found on <a data-udi="umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473" href="/{localLink:umb://document/ae52b40037474a3eadb1c0692c464473}" title="Lake Garda">Lake Garda</a>, therefore the quality of the grapes is very high which is something the owners and producers are keen to keep as a focus. <br /><br />This makes the wines more special as they selectively pick grapes to create a more superior flavour. The wines created at the Cantina are typically light and fresh and should be drunk young, they also offer a great range of sparkling wines to enjoy on a hot summers evening. <br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="4"></a>4. Slovenian Wine Tour, Lake Bled, Slovenia</h2>

It could be argued that they wish to keep their treasures for themselves, but as more and more people taste these wines, the demand will no doubt increase! We offer a 3 or 4 day wine tours that you can conveniently add on to your holiday. <br /><br />Starting at the Goriška Brda region. Many describe this area as the “Tuscany of Slovenia” and it’s not surprising. The vineyard lined hillsides are a striking resemblance to ones that you would find in Italy. <br /><br />In Goriška Brda, wine making is considered a very serious practice and this type of commitment and passion can be tasted in every drop. You will also be given the opportunity to head to the village of Smartno and visit a lookout tower where you will be able to see from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea.<br /><br />Next day you will visit the Vipava Valley, where wine making is a big part of the local community. Not only are there some great large wine producers, but also there is an abundance of smaller wineries located higher up in the hills. <br /><br />You’ll stop at the local village of Zalosce to pick up your farmers picnic for the day before you are taken on a picturesque walk through the vineyards and then shortly returning to the village for a wine tasting. <br /><br />On the last day of the tour you visit the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Skocjan Caves to sample the famous Teran mineral wine. <br /><br />The Karst region wine producers tend to like to keep things local, producing smaller batches to the other areas. Due to the rich limestone in the regional soils you may find a slightly different taste to the wines you sample. Another difference you will find is that some of the cellars are carved into the caves which provide a really nice, quirky touch to the tour. <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends: </strong> The <a data-udi="umb://document/f965d072317649c8a56f2adbaa23eacc" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f965d072317649c8a56f2adbaa23eacc}" title="Hotel Kompas">Hotel Kompas</a> is roughly 5 minutes walk out of town and has a fantastic outdoor terrace where you can enjoy stunning views over <a data-udi="umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/e0872feec9b24b8db1b30d83108b172e}" title="Lake Bled">Lake Bled</a> and the historical Bled castle. <br /><br /></p>

This is mainly due to the northern alpine range mixed with the southern Mediterranean temperatures. The height of the surrounding mountains protect the vineyards from the cold winds whereas the valley allows access for warmer temperatures to push through, it’s like a giant wind breaker! <br /><br />It is believed the wine reflects the attitudes and personalities of the local people, it’s the elegance of the north missed with the vigour of the south, described as “the wisdom of mountain folk and the passion of the dolce vita.” <br /><br />What does this mean for the wines? Well, it means you get some really strong, full bodied red wines and then some more fun and fresh white wines. Best of both worlds! <br /><br /><strong>Inghams recommends:</strong> The fabulous five star <a data-udi="umb://document/8d7a83200b954c858bcfb2007c1d6644" href="/{localLink:umb://document/8d7a83200b954c858bcfb2007c1d6644}" title="Park Hotel Mignon">Mignon Park Hotel</a> is run by the Amort family and they are very proud of the establishment they manage and rightly so.
