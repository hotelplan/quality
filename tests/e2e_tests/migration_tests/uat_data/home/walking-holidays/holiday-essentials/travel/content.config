<h2>Travel by air</h2>
<p><strong>Fly Direct From 20 UK Airports</strong></p>
<p>Our range of UK airports helps keep your journey times to a minimum, and for your added convenience, we can also arrange your airport car-parking or an overnight airport hotel for you in advance – see details below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Connecting Flights Via Europe</strong></p>
<p>Inghams has negotiated special rates to selected destinations with the following European airlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>K.L.M. via Amsterdam</li>
<li>S.A.S. via Copenhagen/Oslo</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Flight details and full flight times will be given at the time of booking. You have a short flight from your UK airport to Amsterdam/Copenhagen/Oslo where you change aircraft before flying to your chosen destination. Your luggage is checked through to your final destination (except in Oslo, where you will have to reclaim your baggage).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>British Airways via Gatwick/Heathrow</strong></p>
<p>For a £75 supplement we can offer connecting flights to airports shown in the table above from: Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey, Leeds-Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle. We recommend you book early in order to get the lowest tour operator economy booking class from Gatwick or Heathrow</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>"Scheduled/Low Cost" Carriers</strong></p>
<p>Low cost airlines do not offer meals and drinks though sometimes these can be purchased on board. Flight baggage allowance is one piece of luggage at 20kg on Easyjet, flybe, Jet2, Monarch, Norwegian and Thomson Airways. Ryanair is one piece of luggage at 15kg per person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“No-Frills” Carriers</strong></p>
<p>No-frills airlines do not offer meals and drinks though sometimes these can be purchased on board. Flight baggage allowance is one piece of luggage at 20kg on Easyjet, flybe, Jet2, Monarch and Thomson Airways. Ryanair is one piece of luggage at 15kg per person.</p>
<div class="hr hr-spaced"></div>
<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>Complimentary food and beverages are continuously being reviewed by airlines and may no longer be offered free to economy class and charter flight passengers. All of our charter airlines (with the exception of Austrian Airlines) offer a ‘buy on board’ meal service.</p>
<div class="hr hr-spaced"></div>
<h2>Baggage Allowances</h2>
<p>All European flights (charter and scheduled), now limit each passenger to one item of checked in luggage weighing either 18 or 20kg. Exact details will be on your e-ticket</p>
<div class="hr hr-spaced"></div>
<h2>Pre-Bookable Seating Arrangements</h2>
<p>To ensure your party sits together, you can pre-book seats on the following airlines: Austrian Airlines and Thomson Airways (Innsbruck, Salzburg and Verona only).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Simply reserve your seats at the time of booking up to 12 days before departure for a small charge of £9 per person return. Please note that seats may be separated by an aisle due to aircraft configurations. Exact seat numbers are given at check in. Should we cancel or change your airline to one that is not part of this scheme, we will issue a full refund.</p>
<div class="hr hr-spaced"></div>
<h2>UK Airport Car Parking</h2>
<p><strong>3 Great Offers For Your Convenience</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Up to <strong>35% discount</strong> at all UK Airports</li>
<li>Special Airport Hotel Offers from only £35 per person! Including FREE PARKING</li>
<li>Meet and Greet valet parking at airports from only £45</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Valet parking is ideal. Simply drive to the airport terminal where an APH representative meets you and takes your car to their nearby secure car park. On your return, your car is then delivered back to you directly at the terminal for you to drive straight off home.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Private Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Private Transfers are also available for the ultimate speed and convenience, and you can pre-book a private taxi transfer with us from the airport to your hotel. We offer private taxi transfers to groups of two to six people booking a full package with accommodation. Prices are shown in the table to the right. If your group is larger than six people, please contact us for a quote. You can book a private transfer up to 14 days before departure, but we recommend you confirm this at time of booking to ensure it is reserved for you.</p>
<p><strong>Transfers to your resort</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer to your accommodation from the airport is normally by coach, except in Switzerland and Constance. Occasionally this will be by or include transport by minibus, taxi, train or boat. Guests travelling to different resorts may be on the same coach, and the transfer itinerary may include dropping off guests at resorts en route.</li>
<li>Approximate distances and transfer times from overseas airports to resorts (excl. time at the airport) are shown on each resort page. Journey times may vary due to traffic and weather conditions. Times given are only a guide.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to wait for guests arriving on other flights, but we try to keep waiting time to a minimum.</li>
<li>In a few Austrian/Italian resorts it may not be possible for the coach to reach the hotel due to the layout of the resort centre. We will try to arrange for the hotels to send a taxi/minibus to collect you and/or your luggage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transfers and Travel in Switzerland</strong></p>
<p>  <br /><strong>Transfers to Swiss Resorts and Lake Constance</strong><br />Transfers in Switzerland via Zurich and Geneva airports are by train, using the excellent Swiss Federal and mountain railways. Your journey may involve changes of trains, and some transfers also involve travel by a local bus, boat or cable car. Zurich and Geneva have railway stations within the airport. Onward transfers within resorts to/from your accommodation are included by taxi/minibus/bus where necessary. Swiss trains, railway stations etc. operate a ‘no-smoking’ policy. Some competitors charge<br />£115 per person for rail transfers in Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>First-class</strong><br />First-class rail tickets are available for Swiss transfers (and Lake Constance, Germany) at a supplement:</p>
<ul>
<li>£33 Single-centre holidays</li>
<li>£33 ‘Mont Blanc Express’ (upgrade applies on Swiss trains only from Martigny to Visp)</li>
<li>£40 Single-centre holidays for Lake Constance</li>
<li>£63 ‘Glorious Glacier Express’, ‘Lake to Lake UNESCO with Golden Pass’ &amp; ‘Undiscovered Switzerland with William Tell Express’ (3-centre holidays). Scenic train seat reservations are issued locally, where applicable</li>
<li>£83 Two-centre combinations</li>
<li>£50 for each additional centre</li>
</ul>
<p>NB. These must be booked at time of confirmation.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Swiss Half-Price Card</strong><br />Worth over £80, this card is included in the holiday price for all Inghams guests travelling to Switzerland. This entitles you to a 50% reduction on first or second class travel on most of the Swiss Transport network, including all mainline railways, regular public and postbus routes (not PTT excursions), most lake ferries and steamers and many cable cars and mountain railways.</p>
<p>When pre-booking a ‘Swiss Pass’, this is issued in addition to your Half-Price card &amp; resort transfer ticket</p>
<p><strong>Fly-Luggage – Switzerland (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>Swiss Travel System operate a service which enables you to send your luggage all the way from your UK airport, on check-in, to your hotel in Switzerland. This service is available to all guests flying to Geneva or Zurich airports at an extra cost from £14 per item each way. Please purchase at time of booking.  From Summer 2016, there is an additional charge of Sfr30 per booking per way for the quicker ‘Express service’, which is available if your flight lands into Switzerland before 11:30am.</p>
<p>N.B. Fly-luggage is no longer available for the resorts Weggis, Vitznau or Saas Fee, and is not recommended for guests travelling to Constance.</p>
<p><strong>Please note the following important information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outward journey</strong></p>
<p>• Check-in your luggage at your UK airport, with your green fly-rail baggage label attached (issued with your transfer tickets if fly-luggage is pre-booked).<br />• Please note if booking the ‘Standard’ service, your luggage will normally arrive at your destination station in the evening after you arrive in Switzerland, so it is vital that you carry an overnight bag with you with all essentials.<br />• Please note if booking the ‘Express’ service your luggage will normally arrive at your hotel the evening of your day of arrival.<br />• Luggage will arrive in resort at the railway station and be collected and brought to your accommodation for you by your Inghams representative (system varies by resort).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Homeward journey</strong></p>
<p>• Please note if booking the ‘Standard’ service, luggage normally needs to be sent from your Swiss resort back to the airport the day before your flight home. Your Inghams representative will arrange this for you.<br />• Please note if booking the ‘Express’ service, your luggage normally needs to be sent from your Swiss resort back to the airport the morning of your departure. This service is only available locally for flights leaving Zurich or Geneva after 4pm.<br />• Please note: You may only be able to send your luggage as far as Geneva or Zurich airport. For security reasons you may need to collect it at the airport railway station and check-in for your flight with it as normal.<br />• If you are flying with Swiss International Airlines, you can normally send you luggage back to your UK airport without collecting it at the Swiss airport. Please note that this service is not included in the basic holiday package.</p>

<p><a name="selfdrive"></a><strong>Self Drive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Driving to your holiday destination from the UK can be a convenient way to travel at your own pace.  We offer our holidays with return ferry or Eurotunnel Channel crossings instead of flights for a reduced price  All we ask is you arrive and depart your accommodation the same date as you flight arrivals.</strong> </p>
<p>To book, select your accommodation, and either a P&amp;O Ferries or Eurotunnel crossing, then call our reservations team for a quote.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Car Reductions</strong></strong></p>
<p>To calculate the price of your self-drive holiday, simply take the price of a holiday by air and deduct <strong>£150</strong> per person (£85 per person if travelling to Switzerland).</p>
<p><strong><strong>P&amp;O Ferries</strong></strong></p>
<p>You can choose one of the following routes:-</p>
<p>• <strong>Dover to Calais</strong>: Six Super-ferries operate the 75 minute crossing. You can upgrade to P&amp;O Ferries’ Club Plus service for just <strong>£13</strong> per person each way plus <strong>£7</strong> per car each way. This allows you access to the exclusive Club Lounge with complimentary tea, coffee, soft drinks, newspapers, waiter service and snack menu and priority boarding and disembarkation. If you prefer you can upgrade separately; Club Lounge <strong>£13</strong> per person each way, Priority Boarding <strong>£13</strong> per car each way.<br />Children aged 5-11 yrs eat <strong>FREE</strong> on P&amp;O Services!</p>

Priority boarding can be pre-booked for a supplement of <strong>£13</strong> per car each way.</p>
<p><strong>Eurotunnel</strong></p>
<p>Eurotunnel runs up to three services an hour during peak periods between Folkstone and Calais and offers the quickest method of taking your car across the channel. The journey takes just 35 minutes platform to platform. Please note: Eurotunnel does not accept LPG/Dual powered vehicles. If your vehicle is over 1.85m in height, high space must be reserved.<br />You can choose to <strong>upgrade your travel to Eurotunnel </strong>at a cost of <strong>£29</strong> per car.

<p><strong>Important Information</strong></p>
