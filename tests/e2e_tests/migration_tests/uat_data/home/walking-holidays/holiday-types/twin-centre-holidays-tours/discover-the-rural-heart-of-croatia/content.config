<p class="p1"><strong>Croatia has many hidden treasures and one of them is the amazing countryside lying between the coasts of the Istrian peninsula.</strong> It is home to different types of terrain, from lush green pastures to the mountains of Uĉka. Motovun in the centre of the peninsula is Croatia’s Tuscany, a pretty hilltop town with overwhelming views of the River Mirna Valley. This pleasant land is the easiest to see and perfect for long walks, hikes and strolls. At the north-west corner of the peninsula is the village of Brtonigla, set in the heart of the Parenzana Way, an ancient railway route running from the Italian city of Trieste along the Istrian coast and deep into the heart of the Croatian countryside. The rail tracks have long gone leaving behind a pretty rural route to walk and explore. Visiting these rural locations brings with it an opportunity to try some mouth watering regional specialities. Each area has its own traditional cuisines using only the best and freshest ingredients and complimented by the local wine.</p>
