<h2>Itinerary</h2>
<p><strong>DAY 1</strong><br />Fly from the UK to Lyon, and transfer to Lyon port to embark the <strong>Amadeus Symphony</strong> in the afternoon. There is a welcome cocktail party before dinner is served on board.  The ship leaves Lyon in the course of the evening.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 2</strong><br />In the morning you arrive at <strong>Mâcon</strong>, a town set in the lovely countryside adjoining the river Saône in the south of Burgundy.  After breakfast, there is a tour of 'Mâconais and Museum of wine'*.  The romantic Beaujolais scenery, with its castles and vineyards, unfolds as we drive along the wine trail. The highlight of this excursion is a visit to a museum dedicated to all aspects of Beaujolais, the world-famous wine, which of course includes a wine-tasting session. After lunch, back on board, there is a trip to Cluny Abbey*. In the early Middle Ages it was Europe's most influential monastery, controlling several hundred monastic foundations throughout Europe, as far afield as Scotland and Poland. Cluny's abbey church was the world's largest Christian structure until the building of St. Peter's in Rome. Unfortunately only a few remnants of the Cluny Abbey survived the French revolution but it is still impressive.  After dinner the Amadeus Symphony continues its journey to Chalon-sur-Saône.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 3</strong> <br />Once we have docked in <strong>Chalon-sur-Saône</strong>, those who have booked the excursion 'Beaune and the Burgundy excursion'* drive to Beaune, the wine-growing centre. In addition to visiting Hôtel-Dieu, which was an alms-house dating back to the 15th Century, this trip guides you through the history of viniculture and includes a wine-tasting session at a famous tavern. After lunch is a visit to the medieval villages of 'Brancion and Cormatin'*. Take a pleasant stroll through Brancion, with its old castle towering above, then visit the magnificent castle of Cormatin with its extensive gardens.  If you prefer not to go on this excursion, you can stay on board and just watch the lovely Burgundian landscape passing by. The vessel stops briefly in the evening in <strong>Tournus</strong>, where those who have been on the excursion rejoin the ship.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 4</strong><br />The Amadeus Symphony docks back in <strong>Lyon</strong> early in the morning.  Our Guided tour of Lyon* offers you the chance to absorb the city's most important sights. The centre of the city has an impressive wealth of elegant squares and ancient buildings (those in the central Place des Terreaux are particularly impressive). The old quarter on the bank of the Saône has been a World Heritage Site since 1998.  During lunch our ship continues its voyage south.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 5</strong><br />We arrive at <strong>Avignon</strong> after breakfast. The folk-song about its old stone bridge has made this city's name famous all over the world.  Avignon is one of the few cities whose medieval walls have been almost completely preserved. The Popes who resided in Avignon were responsible for building its vast imposing Palais des Papes, whose steeply rising façade bears witness to their hegemony.  It can be visited in the morning in the course of our Guided walk round the city*. In the afternoon you can either savour the hustle and bustle in the narrow streets and squares of Avignon's old quarter or join our excursion to the Pont du Gard and Uzès*. The perfectly preserved Pont du Gard ranks as one of the architectural masterpieces of the ancient world. For more than two thousand years this Roman aqueduct supplied water to vast tracts of the Roman provinces in southern France. This trip includes time to stroll through the picturesque little town of Uzès with its narrow streets and sleepy squares before we return to the ship for dinner. The vessel remains moored overnight in Avignon.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 6</strong><br />In the morning you can join our trip to the unique coastal scenery of the Camargue*. Land and sea seem to merge in the marshlands of the Camargue, where nature reigns and, if you are lucky, you might see some of its famous wild horses and flamingoes. The excursion ends in <strong>Arles</strong>. This city has plenty of historical buildings and Roman remains to explore during our City walk* or on your own. After dinner the vessel travels upstream again</p>
<p><strong>DAY 7</strong><br />From <strong>Viviers</strong> you can visit one of France's most interesting geographical features, the Ardèche gorge*. Over several millennia waterpower has carved this very romantic gorge out through limestone.  The coach will follow the river as it meanders through the gorge, which is 300 meters deep in places, and you will see the famous Pont d´Arc - a natural stone bridge that has become an icon for the Ardèche region. Meanwhile the Amadeus Symphony continues to <strong>Le Pouzin</strong>, where those who have been on the coach trip rejoin it. The last stretch starts during lunch as the vessel returns to Lyon.  On this final evening of your cruise, the captain welcomes everyone to a special dinner and the ship's splendid orchestra, which entertains in the bar throughout the cruise, will do its best to persuade you to take a turn on the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>DAY 8</strong><br />Disembarkation is after breakfast in <strong>Lyon</strong>.  End of the cruise and transfer to Lyon airport for your return flight to the UK.</p>
<p>Please note: Itinerary subject to change. *Optional excursions are available to pre-book.</p>
