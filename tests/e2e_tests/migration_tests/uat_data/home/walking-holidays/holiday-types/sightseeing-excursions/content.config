  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>We have compiled an enticing range of excursions in each destination. Some excursions can be booked in advance when you confirm your holiday and others can be purchased in resort from your resort representative. Details and prices of all our excursions are shown on the resort pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you haven't taken advantage already, you can arrange your excursions prior to your arrival in resort. Many people prefer to pre-book prior to departure from the UK, enabling them to arrive in resort with minimal organisation required. In addition, if you pre-book more than 4 weeks prior to departure, adding excursions to your booking is free (or £15 if within 4 weeks prior to departure).</p>
