<p style="color: #003155;"><strong>Are there any restrictions or additional measures required in resort?</strong></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our holidays will be subject to the local Covid-19 regulations of the destination country, and those of our airlines or transport providers, at the time of travel. These regulations may change up to the time of departure and may be different to the regulations we are experiencing in the UK. </span></span></p>

As part of our In Safe Hands promise, you can choose to move your Summer 2022/23 holiday to a later date, up to the point that your full balance is due, with no admin fee from us. You will need to cover any extra cost if your new date is more expensive. If our suppliers charge a fee for the change we may need to pass this on.

<p><a name="FullyVaccinated"></a></p>
<p style="color: #003155;"><strong>Do I need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before travelling?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are paying constant attention to the guidance from the FCDO, ABTA and Public Health England in the UK, as well as to the guidance from the local health authorities in our destinations, this includes their guidance on whether vaccines are necessary to travel from the UK or to your destination country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that you check the number of doses and length of validity required for the last administered dose of the vaccine (which may include a booster dose) as this does vary by country. You can visit our </span><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/travel-advice/coronavirus/entry-requirements#TravelAdviceperCountry"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 entry requirements page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will explain what vaccines, testing and other requirements you need to meet to travel to that country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also recommend that you visit the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website for the most up to date information as things can change at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your responsibility to ensure you have the required vaccinations and/or additional tests in line with the entry requirements to your holiday destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or one of your travelling companions has not received both vaccinations and this is an entry requirement of your holiday destination you may be required to quarantine on arrival and undertake additional testing during your holiday. If you are not willing to take additional tests or quarantine on arrival, our usual </span><a href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/legal/terms-conditions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cancellation terms and conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> apply.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="EntryRequirements"></a></p>
<p><strong>If the entry requirements change for my holiday destination, what does this mean for my holiday?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are paying constant attention to the guidance from the FCDO, ABTA and Public Health England in the UK, as well as to the guidance from local health authorities, to ensure our destinations are open to travellers from the UK. Any additional entry testing and vaccination requirements differ by country and are being reviewed and updated frequently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your responsibility to ensure you have the required vaccinations and/or additional tests in line with the entry requirements for your holiday destination. It is imperative that you check the latest requirements at the time of booking and are able to meet them. For more information, please see our Entry Requirements table, or visit the FCDO website for your destination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If new vaccination requirements are brought in for your holiday destination within 28 days of your travel date and you are not able to meet the new requirements - due to insufficient time or lack of access in the UK - you can move your holiday to a later date in Summer 2022 /23 with no admin fee to pay.</span></p>
