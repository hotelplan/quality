  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Skis and snowboards can be taken to your ski resort, although the number allowed on charter flights is strictly limited. If you have your own equipment, you should pre-book ski/snowboard carriage when you confirm your booking to ensure that space is reserved. A charge will apply for each set of items. On scheduled flights, charges apply to carry sports equipment. This can often be considerably more than that of a charter flight.</span></p>]]></answer>
