  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>The majority of our holidays are packages and include: transportation, accommodation and transfers to/from resort. You should check carefully that the holiday you intend to book includes the items you want. If you book online, a breakdown of what is included is displayed when booking online and you will be advised of what your holiday includes when you book over the phone. If, when you book, you are not given a flight option, no flights or transfers will be included. Your invoice will only outline what is included, not detail what is not included.</span></p>]]></answer>
