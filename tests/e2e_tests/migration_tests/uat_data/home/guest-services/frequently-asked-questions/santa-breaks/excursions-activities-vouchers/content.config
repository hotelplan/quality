  <answer><![CDATA[<p>As a trip to Santa’s Workshop is included for all guests, there is no need for a voucher as all the information is passed directly on to the workshop helpers in advance. For guests who have pre-booked one of our other exciting activities – the Combined Husky &amp; Reindeer Safari, Ski Taster (4-night holidays only) or a Snowmobiling Adventure – vouchers for these will be issued in your welcome information pack provided on arrival at Kittilä Airport.</p>

These activities are also available to book locally, subject to availability, but we recommend you pre-book in advance to guarantee your place.</p>]]></answer>
