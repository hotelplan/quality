  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Yes, guests on our 4-night Santa Breaks to both Levi and Ylläs have an opportunity to go downhill skiing. Complete beginners can pre-book a great value ‘Ski Taster’ package, which includes 1.5hrs tuition, equipment hire and free use of the beginner lifts for the full day so they can practise their newly learnt skills. These packages are bookable for both adult and children aged 5 and above, but please note that adults and child tuition takes place in different groups.  More experienced skiers can book equipment and lift pass for the slopes from a half-day upwards locally.</span></p>]]></answer>
