  <answer><![CDATA[<p>You need to supply APIS information from the travel document (usually passport) that you intend to use for travel to your destination. Please ensure that the travel document is valid for your destination. If you wish to be kept updated during periods of travel delay, we would strongly recommend that you provide your mobile number, so that we may communicate up-to-date information to you via our Text Alert system. If you have booked through a Travel Agent and they provide their own contact details, they then assume responsibility for passing on any text information received to you.</p>]]></answer>
