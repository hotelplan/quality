  <answer><![CDATA[<p><strong>Inghams is an Unregulated Introducer of Campbell Irvine Ltd who are authorised and regulated by the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="FCA">Financial Conduct Authority</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We don't sell our own holiday insurance. You can purchase insurance with our recommended provider for walking holidays <a href="https://campbellirvinedirect.com/inghamssummer">here</a> and for winter sport specific travel <a href="https://campbellirvinedirect.com/inghamswinter">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is a condition of booking with us that you and your party take out suitable hiking and winter sports Insurance from a reputable provider. Please note that a standard travel insurance policy, including many ‘free’ bank and credit card policies, will not cover hiking to an altitude above 2000m or winter activities such as skiing, husky, reindeer and snowmobile safaris and we ask you to please check with your insurance policy provider that you have adequate cover for any activities you plan to participate in, including the optional Guided Walks.</p>]]></answer>
