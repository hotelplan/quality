  <answer><![CDATA[<p>As of the 1st January 2021, the UK has left the EU. Here’s what you need to know before travelling with us:</p>
<p><strong>Driving in the EU: </strong>From 28 September UK stickers will replace GB stickers. Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK before, on or after 28 September 2021.</p>
<p>If you are hiring a car, ensure you have a green card. In both cases you must make sure that you have the relevant international driving insurance with your chosen provider.</p>
<p><strong>GHIC Cards and Travel Insurance:</strong> Under a new agreement with the EU, UK residents are now able to apply for a UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) if your current European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) has expired. This will give you access to emergency and medically necessary healthcare in the EU during your holiday. GHIC cards are FREE and can be applied for on the NHS website: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/">Applying for healthcare cover abroad (GHIC and EHIC) - NHS (www.nhs.uk)</a>. You can still use your EHIC card, excluding Switzerland and Norway, if it is still valid and in date and as part of our terms and conditions, you must also still hold valid travel insurance to cover your personal circumstances, (pre-existing conditions, etc). In Norway, you can show your UK Passport to receive limited urgent healthcare.</p>
<p>You should ensure that all members of your travelling party are in possession of a comprehensive travel insurance policy covering their individual needs and the type of holiday and activities booked. This should be arranged as soon as possible after confirming your booking, so that you are covered from the outset. While the GHIC card will give you access to some medical healthcare and assistance (some insurance policies insist upon an EHIC/GHIC being held and used in the first instance), it does not cover costs of, for example, medical repatriation to the UK, which can be costly. You should ensure that your chosen insurance policy covers medical repatriation from your chosen destination, as well as cover for personal belongings, loss of baggage/equipment/money, pre-existing medical conditions, cancellation fees, other medical expenses and assistance costs.</p>
<p><strong>Data Roaming:</strong> Free data roaming will cease, therefore you need to be aware of any additional charges for using your phone and data abroad. Most of our properties have complimentary Wi-Fi for guests to use, but please remember that this is for social usage only.</p>
<p><strong>ATOL &amp; ABTA:</strong> As we are an ATOL and ABTA bonded UK travel company, guests booking with us enjoy comprehensive consumer protection. Your holiday will be protected under the Package Travel Regulations, which means you have the right to a full refund if, for any reason, we can no longer provide your holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Visas: </strong>In Autumn 2024 we expect to see the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) – an automated IT system for registering non-EU nationals travelling for a short stay (up to 90 days within any 180 day period) each time they cross the external borders of European countries. It is anticipated that this will replace passport stamping and automate border control procedures. For more information on EES, please visit: <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees/general-information_en">General information - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>
<p>From 2025 onwards the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will be effective, which will require visa-exempt EU nationals, including UK citizens, to hold an electronic authorisation to travel to or within the Schengen Zone (currently 27 EU member states, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus). An ETIAS travel authorisation is a visa waiver which will be required regardless of the length of your visit. Once granted, it will be valid for 3 years or until your passport expires. It can only be applied for online and a fee will be payable unless an exemption applies. If you are unable to travel on your holiday because you have not obtained an ETIAS travel authorisation, our normal cancellation charges will apply. For more information on ETIAS, please visit: <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias/what-etias_en">What is ETIAS - European Union (europa.eu)</a></p>
<p><strong>Travel Disruption:</strong> When entering and exiting countries, it is your responsibilty to give yourself extra time to get through the immigration queues in the airports as there will be delays. We may have to organise our transfers slightly to help with this and ensure that you have extra time.</p>
