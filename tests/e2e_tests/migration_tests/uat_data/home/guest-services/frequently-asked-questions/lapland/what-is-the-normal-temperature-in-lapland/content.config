  <answer><![CDATA[<p>During December it is normally between - 5°C and -12°C, but it can reach as low as - 30°. Temperatures in January/February range from - 5°C to - 20°C, before they rise again during the longer days in March/April to range from - 1°C and - 15°C. These temperatures are perfectly manageable however with the thermal suits and boots provided. Our resort staff and activity providers are also well experienced in operating in these conditions, although they reserve the right to amend itineraries if weather conditions dictate.</p>]]></answer>
