  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Yes! Guests in Levi and Saariselkä have the opportunity to pre-book an overnight stay in a glass igloo for the ultimate Northern Lights experience. The igloo locations are approximately 15-20 minutes from resort and our prices include return transfers, evening meal and breakfast. This is often described by our guests as the highlight of their week. It is best to book early as availability can be limited as the season starts. The exact night of your stay will be confirmed approximately 3 days after booking.</p>]]></answer>
