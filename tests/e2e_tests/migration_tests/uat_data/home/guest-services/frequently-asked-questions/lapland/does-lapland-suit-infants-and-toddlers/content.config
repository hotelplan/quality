  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Due to the low temperatures, holidays to Lapland are not recommended for very small infants under 2 years of age. Toddlers 2-3 years generally love the excitement and magic of it all including Santa’s Workshop and sledging in the snow. Although children under 4years old are not able to join any snowmobile safaris, they are welcome to join the husky and reindeer safari excursion free of charge. A small charge applies for the transportation to the excursion location, payable locally.</p>]]></answer>
