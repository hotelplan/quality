  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Ski buses operate in all of the resorts and charge a small daily fee, or a reduced weekly price. Children under the age of 6 years usually travel for free if accompanied by a parent and a small discount is applied to guests with a lift pass. Buses operate frequently around the resort so are a good way of getting around even if you do not plan to ski. Guests staying at the Akäs Hotel and Akäs Alp Apartments can use the ski bus for free during their stay.</p>]]></answer>
