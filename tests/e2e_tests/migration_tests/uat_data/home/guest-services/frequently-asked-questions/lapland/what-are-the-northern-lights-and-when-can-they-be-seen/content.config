  <answer><![CDATA[<p>The ‘Aurora Borealis’, more commonly known as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon caused by solar particles colliding with the earth’s magnetic field. As a natural event, no one can predict or guarantee their appearance during your stay. However, being above the Arctic Circle, Levi, Ylläs and Saariselkä are all ideal locations to see them and it is possible for them to appear as soon as the sky turns dark so keep an eye out! Although the best chances to see them is to head to a remote spot, they can also regularly be spotted from the resort centres or your accommodation, particularly if you are in one of the Log Cabins.</p>]]></answer>
