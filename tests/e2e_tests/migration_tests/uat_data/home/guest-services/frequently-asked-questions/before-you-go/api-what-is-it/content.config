  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>Commonly referred to as API - is the term given to details required by airlines prior to travel. These details are taken from your official travel document, usually the machine readable page of your passport, and will be sent to the government authorities of the country you are arriving into. As part of tightened security procedures, all airlines are required to submit API in advance of travel to specific destinations in the EU and around the world. This allows the authorities to make routine identity checks on passengers before arrival.</span></p>
<p><span>If you wish to be kept updated during periods of travel delay, we would strongly recommend that you provide your mobile number, so that we may communicate up-to-date information to you via our Text Alert system. If you have booked through a Travel Agent and they provide their own contact details, they then assume responsibility for passing on any text information received to you.</span></p>]]></answer>
