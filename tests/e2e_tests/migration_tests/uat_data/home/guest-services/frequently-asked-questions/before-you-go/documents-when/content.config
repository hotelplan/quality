  <answer><![CDATA[<p><span>10 days before your holiday you will be sent your holiday documents which are titled </span><strong>‘Your Travel Itinerary &amp; E-Ticket'</strong><span>. This is the documentation you will need to check in for your holiday (along with your passport and applicable visa, of course). For all Customers, except those travelling to Switzerland or on a Tour, your holiday documents will be sent to you by email (where an email address has been provided). Customers travelling to Switzerland and on Tours will receive documents by post, as Swiss rail tickets will need to be posted to you. Please note these documents will not outline specific room aspects or transfer arrangements, you need to refer to your holiday invoice for these.</span></p>]]></answer>
