  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Seats cannot be requested in our transfers.</p>
<p>If you are travelling between hotels with us, you will be advised of the arrangements for your transfer to your next hotel by your rep, towards the end of your initial stay.</p>
<p>If you have chosen a private transfer, once you have collected your luggage you should speak to an Inghams Rep who will take you to your private transfer.</p>
<p>If you’ve arranged your own transport, please call Reservations on <strong>01486 791111</strong> or let your Travel Agent know so we can advise the Inghams Reps.</p>]]></answer>
