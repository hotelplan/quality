  <answer><![CDATA[<p>Our team of Inghams’ representatives will meet you on arrival in resort wherever possible according to the train connections advised on your rail itinerary. If your hotel is not within walking distance from the hotel/bus station, a pick-up will be arranged for you to take you to your hotel with your luggage. Very occasionally the representative will not be available to greet you, but the hotel pick-up is organised for all guests. Just look out for an Inghams sign.</p>]]></answer>
