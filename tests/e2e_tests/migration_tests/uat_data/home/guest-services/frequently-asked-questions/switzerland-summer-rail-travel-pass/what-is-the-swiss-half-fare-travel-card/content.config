  <answer><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss Half-Fare Travel Card is included in our prices for all guests staying Switzerland with us, including guests travelling to resort by car, rail from the UK or just booking accommodation only with us. The card gives you up to 50% discount on individual 1st and 2nd class fares on most of the superb Swiss Transport Network, so you can explore as much as you like at up to half the cost.</p>
<p>If you are looking to use the local transport or walking lifts extensively when you are on holiday, we also recommend pre-booking a regional travel pass, which are usually available from 3 – 6 days depending on resort and in combination with your included half-fare travel card which gives you a discount (included in our prices), are a great value to explore the local area.</p>]]></answer>
