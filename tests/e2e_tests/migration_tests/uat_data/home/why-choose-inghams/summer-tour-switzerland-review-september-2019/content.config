  <description><![CDATA[The tour was well organised, with good accommodation and friendly and helpful staff. Our itinerary was a good mix of activities which was both interesting and fun. Transfer days were made into excursions in their own right which felt part of the whole experience. Our tour manager looked after us well and made it all happen seamlessly. Swiss efficiency certainly lived up to it's reputation!]]></description>
