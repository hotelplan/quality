  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Special ski packs are available in most resorts and these represent considerable financial savings over separate items.</p>
<p><strong>3 great reasons to pre-book your ski packs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lift passes - beat the line!</strong> No one likes having to wait for their lift pass in a long, cold line at the ticket window! So we make it easy for you. Pre-book your lift pass in advance and your Inghams Rep will collect and deliver it to you before the lifts open on your first day – sometimes even on the coach from the airport! With our cast iron lift pass price guarantee we promise that the price you pay when you pre-book will be lower or the same as the price at the local lift pass office.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Save £££s with our special offers</strong>. Huge discounts are available to pre-booking guests, from 2-for-1 and buy 1 get 1 half-price lift passes, to <strong>free </strong>equipment hire offers in selected resorts, not forgetting our special discounted Ski Pack Saver bundles, which include tuition. There are so many great savings to be had and these offers will no longer be available when you get to resort!<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Let Inghams staff take the strain.</strong> Pre-booking takes the stress out of the start of your holiday. Let our overseas teams work with our carefully selected local partners to get everything ready for your arrival. Our Reps are on hand in resort throughout your first morning to ensure you have everything you need and are in the right place at the right time at the start of your holiday.</li>
