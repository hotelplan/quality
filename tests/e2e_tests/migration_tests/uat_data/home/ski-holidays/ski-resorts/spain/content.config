  <description><![CDATA[<p>People sometimes dismiss Spain’s skiing without bothering to discover that it has some seriously good resorts like Formigal, Sierra Nevada, and Baqueira Beret. Not only do Formigal’s four ski valleys - in the province of Huesca, in the Aragon Pyrenees of North-eastern Spain – claim the most extensive slopes in the country: the resort compares favourably with many of the substantial and better known resorts in the Alps. And, by and large, it’s cheaper. Following the central Pyrenean resort’s 120 million Euro investment in new, high-speed lifts four or five years ago, Formigal, in the upper Tena Valley, and less than four miles from the French border, claims to have overtaken its two big Spanish rivals, Baqueira Beret and Sierra Nevada in size. There are three sectors: Tres Hombres, Izas and El Portalet. Each valley is accessible by car and a bus service. Thirty nine of the 93 runs are black, but there is plenty for beginners, and a veritable feast for intermediates. Altogether 21 lifts (10 of them high-capacity) serve 85 miles of groomed runs, and there are seven kilometres of off-piste itineraries, two terrain parks, and a boardercross course. More than 200 instructors work across the four areas.<br /><br />The mountains – although not as high as their Alpine equivalent – are spectacular. Punta Escarra (9,016 ft) resembles the top section of Zermatt’s Matterhorn. The slopes, with 440 snow cannon spread among the four valleys, reach a top altitude of 7,400 feet at the Tres Hombres peak, with a vertical drop of 2,460ft. The resort’s owner, the Aramon Group, is the biggest in Spain. It owns four other ski resorts (Cerler, Javalambre, Panticosa and Valdelinares) – a sixth of the country’s 30+ ski areas. This represents around 20% of the Spanish ski business. There are 17 mountain restaurants, including the Cabaña Izas, where the waiters sometimes dance as well as wait tables. The Cabaña de la Glera, a charming  mountain-hut restaurant alongside Pipos, an enticingly long and winding intermediate run.  <br />It has room for just 18 diners inside, and on special occasions opens at night to cater for groups who are driven there from the Anayet base in a snowcat. <br /><br />By way of contrast, less than 10 miles to the south east of Formigal is the traditional old spa town of Panticosa on the banks of the River Caldares, with it maze of steep narrow streets and large stone-walled houses, and a 13th century Romanesque church. Panticosa was once the haunt of the Spanish royal family. The village, with pine-clad meadows at the bottom of the slopes, is the gateway, via an eight-person gondola, to a delightful family ski resort (vertical drop 2,264ft) with two valley sections: Vallee de Sabocos and Petrosos. The upper Sabocos valley is accessed by a high-speed quad chair. Between them the two areas share more than 40 runs (seven green, 14 blue, 16 red and four black runs) served by 16 lifts, and includes a dedicated snowboard park, a beginners’ area with a magic carpet, and a snow garden.</p>]]></description>
