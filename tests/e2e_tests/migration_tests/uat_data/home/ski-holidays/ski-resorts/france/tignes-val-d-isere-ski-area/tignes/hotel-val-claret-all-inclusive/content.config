  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hotel Val Claret, nestled at the foot of the slopes, offers a friendly and laid back atmosphere with access to some great spa facilities, fantastic location and benefits from an all inclusive package.</p>
<h2>Easy ski access</h2>
<p>You’ll find the Hotel Val Claret All Inclusive in a prime location, right in the centre of <a data-udi="umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565" href="/{localLink:umb://document/204ce8e4cf8c4ab09205501e16cb7565}" title="Tignes">Tignes</a> facing the slopes. The hotel’s main attraction has to be its ski-in ski-out location, which means no trudging back and forth in your heavy ski boots - the closest ski school is only 100 metres from the hotel and the nearest chairlift is only 30 metres away, so you can get going pretty much as soon as you step out of the door.</p>
<h2>Non-ski activities</h2>
<p>If you want to spend some time winding down off the slopes there's also a spa area with a heated indoor swimming pool, sauna and steam room - drop your children off at the kid’s club and have some you time. If you’re feeling more active then you can grab a pair of snow shoes and go for a walk in the snow as it's one of the best ways to take in the scenery and immerse yourself in nature!</p>
<h2>All inclusive package</h2>
<p>With their all-inclusive service you'll have breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus après ski snacks so you wont go hungry here - you can even enjoy a glass of wine (or two) once you’re finished on the slopes. When you’re having lunch or a drink from the bar, make sure you check out the terrace that overlooks the piste. The hotel is a great choice for families as there are lots of activities on offer. In the evenings they have everything from quizzes and cinema nights to karaoke and discos. </p>
