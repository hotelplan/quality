The building is shared exclusively with Chalets <a data-udi="umb://document/50d7f9d96e7c4638bdcc2e69478973f1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/50d7f9d96e7c4638bdcc2e69478973f1}" title="Chalet Chloe">Chloe</a> and <a data-udi="umb://document/66ca5d10cae64be8b9b5fb73ed58606d" href="/{localLink:umb://document/66ca5d10cae64be8b9b5fb73ed58606d}" title="Chalet Noella">Noella</a>. The entrance is on the top floor and a shared staircase leads to the chalets, which are each individually run and hosted. Chalet Mathilde <span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak">is available to book exclusively as well as room by room.</span></span></p>
<h2>Excellent location</h2>
<p><span>The resort is one of the highest ski resorts in Europe at 2,300 metres and is connected to the largest lift linked area, the <a data-udi="umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578" href="/{localLink:umb://document/72a5198213b1400d8c891f49fe57b578}" title="Three Valleys Ski Area">Three Valleys</a>, so all abilities can enjoy great snow coverage and a wide variety of runs. The Chalet Mathilde has a fantastic location in <a data-udi="umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/50690c0f70c74050930d18799cab6fa8}" title="Val Thorens">Val Thorens</a>, at the start of the day walk 100 metres along the road to the Plein Sud blue running through the village, then ski straight to the ski lifts which connect to the Three Valleys or keep right to head down towards <a data-udi="umb://document/4eae720ba8984d83a83f530983b4b6f8" href="/{localLink:umb://document/4eae720ba8984d83a83f530983b4b6f8}" title="Les Menuires">Les Menuires</a>. </span></p>
<p>The resort centre is around a five minute walk away, where you have access to a variety of shops, cafes and bars - on your free evening head to one of the restaurants serving delicious Savoyard dishes such as fondue or raclette. </p>
<h2>Chalet catering</h2>
<p>In order to make your stay as comfortable as possible, your chalet hosts will be available to assist you with each aspect of your holiday. To fuel your ski days, they prepare home-made comfort food, including a cooked breakfast, afternoon tea snacks, and a four-course dinner, with wine, beer and soft drinks, six days a week. On staff day off the hosts will leave a continental breakfast out and you are free to spend the evening however you'd like in resort. In addition to preparing and serving your meals, the hosts will also maintain the cleanliness in the chalet throughout the week. As you are on holiday, all you have to do is get up and go skiing.</p>
<h2>Unwind and relax</h2>
<p>The chalet is decorated in a traditional Alpine fashion, with comfortable furnishings throughout the property including an open planned lounge and dining area. After a day of exploring the Three Valleys head back to the chalet to enjoy a coffee and a tasty afternoon tea treat or head out onto the sun terrace with great views across the resort to catch a bit of winter sun. </p>
<p>After a day on the slopes, take advantage of the shared wellness area. Give your ski legs a break and relax in the sauna or steam-room, available for all guests within the residence. </p>
<h3>Why is this is an Inghams' Choice property?</h3>

<p><strong>Close to resort</strong><span> </span>- The Chalet Mathilde is a short walk to the resort centre where you can find plenty of shops, restaurants and bars.
