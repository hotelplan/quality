<p><strong>One lucky father of 2 teenagers from Waterlooville, won an Inghams ski holiday worth £2000 to <a data-udi="umb://document/b1898c403dbf4e2b8b5f6ea9e6ca2027" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b1898c403dbf4e2b8b5f6ea9e6ca2027}" title="Foersterhaus zum Kramerwirt">Foersterhaus zum Kramerwirt</a>, Mayrhofen in Austria.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a free Inghams competition entry, against the odds, 47-year-old Graham Webster was left speechless after he was told that Inghams were about to ‘Elevate his Winter’ and he and a friend would be heading out on a holiday he said ‘they could’ve never afforded.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The win came after what he described as ‘a couple of very tough years’ and spending over 20 years facing ski holiday postponements and cancellations well before the impacts of Covid hit.</span></p>
<h2>The Ultimate Ski Giveaway</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Elevate your Winter campaign allowed entrants to win a ski holiday for two people to the Austrian resort of <a data-udi="umb://document/f9068cb62c4d4b2299a0ef29fd676ed5" href="/{localLink:umb://document/f9068cb62c4d4b2299a0ef29fd676ed5}" title="Mayrhofen">Mayrhofen</a>—including flights, transfers and 3-star accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="width: 100%px; height: auto;" src="/media/13084993/mayrhofen-ski.jpg?width=825&amp;height=442&amp;mode=max" alt="Mayrhofen ski resort" data-udi="umb://media/94d0e6b61d054bf78566b1e980d21e8e" /></span></p>
<p>Inghams’ winner, Graham Webster said;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was lucky enough to go skiing several times when I was in my teens, until I shattered my right knee playing football and it took 3 years to recover. Not long after, I then snapped my cruciate ligament on my left knee so that was another wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then life took over, I had kids! And finally, Covid, each time we wanted to go skiing things were cancelled or blocked.  Now, thanks to Inghams, I get to retry both skiing and snowboarding, but on a much better scale than I could have afforded.  Previously I was looking at just a few days away to get back into it. The fact I won 7-nights at an amazing resort, with one of the UK leading's ski tour operators is peace of mind that is fantastic for someone like me returning to the slopes after such a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finally getting back on the slopes in February 2022 courtesy of Inghams, Graham and his friend were pleased to confirm they had a fantastic time.</span></p>
<p>Graham added;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday was fantastic from the minute we touched down and were met by our Inghams rep. Foersterhaus zum Kramerwirt hotel is in such an idyllic location, minutes from the cables cars and in the middle of the village, so it was easy to enjoy the sights and get to the slopes. The hotel dates back centuries and has remained in the same family all that time, so you can feel the personal touches. The modifications, like the sauna, marry up perfectly with the traditional style of the hotel itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, this holiday was desperately needed. I hadn't been anywhere in 3 years due to Covid mostly, and to go somewhere where you can breathe in the mountain air whilst enjoying the freedom of the slopes elevated my general wellbeing to a much higher place.”</span></p>

<h2>Hit the slopes like Graham</h2>
<p><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/media/13084989/mayrhofen-ski-6.jpg?width=835&amp;height=448&amp;mode=max" alt="Mayrhofen ski" data-udi="umb://media/b9cc3278894249bda5e99d24cfedfb2e" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Head up to the mountains, strap on some skis, and treat yourself to a ski trip of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Mayrhofen, the highest town in Austria, is known for its local charm and spectacular mountain scenery. The Zillertal ski area has over 535 km of groomed slopes and caters to all abilities. The Hintertux glacier is a great place for powder skiing and boasts fantastic views of the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It is one of the leading destinations for skiers, boarders and freestylers. If you’re a freestyler, don't miss the chance to practice your tricks on Europe's largest snow park – Penken Park. You'll find it on the sunny side of the Hornberg mountain—split into six separate areas, it even has its own chairlift.</p>
