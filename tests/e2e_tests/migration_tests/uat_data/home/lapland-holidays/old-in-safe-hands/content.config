<p>We’re frequently reviewing the information contained on this page and are committed to ensuring that the safety of our guests is our first priority. The information and policies that follow were made in good faith and correct at the time of publication. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the Coronavirus pandemic, we may need to change or update the policies outlined below at short notice and in line with new developments, relevant guidance and legal obligations.</p>
<p>We are paying constant attention to the guidance from the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office’s (FCDO), ABTA and Public Health England in the UK, as well as to the guidance from the local health authorities in Finland. All our holidays are subject to the local Covid-19 regulations of Finland, which may differ from that of the UK. We recommend you are familiar with these before you travel.</p>
<p>For guests who are concerned about their travel plans in light of the Coronavirus outbreak, we answer the most commonly asked questions below.</p>
<p> </p>
<a name="faqs"></a>
<p><strong>In Resort Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will my Lapland experience be different due to Coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>We know a trip to Lapland is a magical experience and we understand that our guests may be feeling a mixture of excitement and nerves, but at this point in time we are confident that we will be able to take you away this year. The health and safety of every guest who travels with us, including our staff and Santa, is always our top priority. Whilst we will be making some small changes to ensure this is possible, we believe that we will still be able to deliver your holiday as you expect it to be.</p>
<p>Due to the constantly changing nature of the Coronavirus crisis, we might need to change or withdraw some advertised accommodation facilities and resort services so we can keep everyone safe. Wherever we can, we’ll let you know about this in advance, but sometimes it might be at very short notice.</p>
<p>Our holidays will be subject to the local Covid-19 regulations in Finnish Lapland and those of our airlines or transport providers, and we recommend that you are familiar with these before you travel. Information can be found on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland" target="_blank" title="Finland Travel Advice">Finland country page</a> of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office’s (FCDO) website, so please ensure that you read these.</p>
<p>For the most up to date information on everything we are doing to make your holiday as safe as possible, please visit both this “Lapland in Safe Hands” and our main “<a data-udi="umb://document/fa72be9e45bc442089252c6a18a0d2ae" href="/{localLink:umb://document/fa72be9e45bc442089252c6a18a0d2ae}" title="In Safe Hands">In Safe Hands</a>” page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What can I expect from my transfer in Lapland?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone, including staff, will be required to wear face coverings when travelling on any transport to and from the resort, including to your activities, in line with local regulations. Please bring your own face coverings, ensuring that you have sufficient spares to change them frequently during your holiday.</p>
<p>All coaches will be regularly cleaned and disinfected throughout the day. Hand sanitiser will be available for guests and staff when boarding your coach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Covid-19 protocols will be in place at my hotel?</strong></p>
<p>We only work with trusted hotels in Lapland and their own local, professional teams will manage them, in-line with the Covid-19 health and safety laws of Finland. Currently, guests are required to maintain a social distance of 1.5m from other guests outside their family group and where food/drink are consumed, everyone must have their own seat to eat. When it is difficult to maintain a social distance of 1.5m, a face covering is recommended.</p>
<p>Due to the constantly changing nature of the Coronavirus crisis, accommodation providers might need to change or withdraw some advertised facilities services so we can keep everyone safe. Wherever we can, we’ll let you know about this in advance, but sometimes it might be at very short notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the rides/activities be cleaned in resort?</strong></p>
<p>If activities or rides are included as part of your holiday, they will be cleaned after each use throughout the day, as well as an enhanced cleaning process before the Santa’s Hideaway and excursion locations open. We politely request that all our guests uphold the highest possible hygiene standards – through regular hand washing and using hand sanitiser when available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will our snowsuits be cleaned?</strong></p>
<p>If a snowsuit is included as part of your holiday, they will be cleaned before each use and you will collect yours via a one-way system on arrival into the resort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will the Santa experience look like?</strong></p>
<p>If you have a Santa experience included as part of your holiday, currently, we do not anticipate that Santa will be wearing a face covering, nor do we expect a screen to be used between Santa and his guests. We will however keep Santa socially distanced from his guests, to ensure everyone is kept safe, whilst still keeping the magic alive, and ensuring your family get their special photo with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will I need to wear a face covering?</strong></p>
<p>Our holidays will be subject to the local Covid-19 regulations in Finnish Lapland, and those of our airlines or transport providers at the time of travel. Due to the constantly changing nature of the Coronavirus pandemic, these regulations may change up to the time of departure and may be different to the regulations we are experiencing in the UK.</p>
<p>Currently face coverings in Finland are only required on public transport, which includes transfers to and from the resort, including to your activities, and are recommended where it is difficult to maintain a distance of 1.5m from others outside your family group. Please bring your own face coverings, ensuring that you have sufficient spares to change them frequently during your holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What training have your staff had?</strong></p>
<p>Our staff and guest’s health and safety is always our top priority. All our staff will complete Covid-19 training relating to our additional health and safety measures, informing them how to stay safe, and how to keep you safe.</p>
<p>All staff will be required to wear face coverings when needed, for example in the airport terminal and on our coach transfers, and at any point when in close proximity to guests. They will manage everything from a central point, electronically and over the phone as much as possible. This is to minimise any risk of spreading infection.</p>
<p>Before starting work each day, they will be required to certify they are not experiencing any Covid-19 symptoms. Any staff experiencing symptoms will not attend work and appropriate actions will be made in line with local regulations and our own protocols.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will I be updated about any changes to my holiday?</strong></p>
<p>In the run up to your holiday, we will provide you with plenty of information about what to expect from your trip and whether any changes have had to be made to your break. We recommend you keep an eye on this “Lapland in Safe Hands” page, which will be updated as and when required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>General Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>How will I know if my travel plans are going to be affected?</strong></p>
<p>The unpredictable impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic means that decisions about changes or amendments to your holiday may occur at any time, and could be no more than a few days before you are due to depart.</p>
<p>We pay constant attention to the guidance from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office’s (FCDO), ABTA, Public Health England and local health authorities in our destinations. We will respond to any advice issued by the FCDO against non-essential travel to Finnish Lapland, and will contact you as soon as it is clear we won’t be able to provide your holiday at the originally planned time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I need to have had one or both of my COVID vaccines before travelling?</strong></p>
<p>We are paying constant attention to the guidance from the Foreign Commonwealth Department Office (FCDO), ABTA and Public Health England in the UK as well as paying attention to guidance from the local health authorities in Finland.</p>
<p>Current guidance states that UK residents may only enter Finland if they can prove they’ve had a complete Covid-19 vaccination series at least 14 days prior to arrival, or have recovered from Covid-19 within the past six months at the point of travel. This does not apply to any children born in 2006 or thereafter. Should you be concerned about this, please call us on 01483 791 111 and we can discuss your options.</p>
<p>Guests will be required to prove their vaccine status using the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" target="_blank">NHS Covid Pass</a> or a certificate of recovery from within the past 6 months. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres will not be accepted by border authorities as proof of vaccination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I’m due to pay my balance for my holiday, can I pay later while I wait and see what happens?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning on taking guests away to Lapland this Christmas and we will start collecting final holiday balances 10 weeks before your trip.</p>
<p>If you choose to cancel your holiday it will be per our <a data-udi="umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821}" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">terms and conditions</a>. After you have paid your full balance, if you choose to cancel your holiday we will not be able to offer a refund on your holiday or added extras and our usual <a data-udi="umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821}" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">cancellation terms apply</a>.</p>
<p>Equally, if we make the decision to suspend your holiday to Finland and you cancelled before we took that action, we will not offer a refund retrospectively. You should therefore ensure that you have adequate travel insurance and seek to recover cancellation charges from your insurer where possible.</p>
<p>If you have underlying health concerns, we would recommend that you speak to your GP and travel insurer, who may offer a degree of cover for cancellation on these grounds, subject to the terms of your policy, and you may need a note from your GP to support your claim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will I be entitled to a refund if Inghams has to cancel or make a significant change to my holiday due to the Coronavirus outbreak?</strong></p>
<p>If things change and we have to cancel your holiday because of Coronavirus, you can move your holiday to another available date or destination of equivalent value, or pay the difference to upgrade your trip. If for any reason you are not able to move your holiday, we’ll give you a refund.</p>
<p>Equally, if we have to make a significant change your holiday, we’ll give you the option of accepting the change or receiving a refund. You can find out more about what would be considered a significant change in our <a data-udi="umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821" href="/{localLink:umb://document/b703ff07ccec43baad41fffcfcc61821}" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">booking terms &amp; conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Please remember it is a condition of our booking terms that you have valid travel insurance. We would strongly recommend that you take travel insurance out at the time of booking that includes Coronavirus cover.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>I’m due to go on holiday with Inghams, but have now contracted Covid-19. What are my options?</strong></p>
<p>If you contract COVID-19 within 14 days of your departure date and have a medical certificate to confirm your diagnosis, you can move your holiday to the same holiday (including accommodation and airline) to a later date in the season, depending on availability, or to the same dates in 2022.</p>
<p>This applies to you and a travel companion sharing the same room, plus any dependents. If you would prefer to cancel your holiday, in the first instance please contact your travel insurance provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I’m due to go to Lapland in the next few days but I’ve been contacted by NHS Test &amp; Trace. Can I still go on holiday?</strong></p>
<p>Please give us a call on 01483 791 111 if this situation arises.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will I be covered by my travel insurance if I decide to cancel or have to self-isolate?</strong></p>
<p>This will depend on the terms of your policy and the reason for your cancellation. If you are concerned about a serious underlying medical condition, you should contact your travel insurance provider to check if you can make a claim.</p>
<p>We would highly recommend that you take out additional Covid-19 travel insurance. Many travel insurance policies will no longer cover you as standard if your holiday is disrupted due to Coronavirus, but there are new policies and add-ons appearing on the market that will cover for any unforeseen circumstances between booking and departing on holiday as well as while on holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if I receive a positive test whilst I’m in Finland before I travel back the UK?</strong></p>
<p>If you receive a positive test result whilst on holiday, you will need to contact your travel insurer for assistance and advice on next steps in the first instance.</p>
<p>Cover will vary dependent on the provider and level of cover you have chosen. You should then contact your Representative (details in your Welcome Pack) so that they are aware, and who will do their best to help and support you.</p>
<p>Our insurance partner Campbell Irvine offer travel insurance with comprehensive Covid-19 cover and will be happy to give you a quote. To contact them, please <a rel="noopener" href="https://campbellirvinedirect.com/inghamswinter/" target="_blank" title="Campbell Irvine - Winter Insurance">visit here</a>.</p>
